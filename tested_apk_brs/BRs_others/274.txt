App Name: Aegis Authenticator

Bug Report Title: First time setup does not require confirming password if "show password" is checked

Issue Description:
During the first time setup, if the user enables biometric unlock and checks the "show password" box, the app does not prompt for password confirmation. Instead, the user is taken directly to the main page, bypassing the confirmation step. This could lead to unintended password entry errors and weakens the setup security.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch the Aegis App
2. Enable biometric unlock (fingerprint) during setup.
3. Type a password and check the "show password" box.
4. Click enter or next without confirming the password.
5. Observe that the app does not prompt for password confirmation and proceeds to the main page (bug: confirmation step skipped).

Expected Behavior:
- The app should always prompt the user to confirm their password during first time setup, regardless of whether "show password" is checked.

Actual Behavior:
- If "show password" is checked, the app skips the password confirmation step and proceeds directly to the main page.

Environment:
- App version: 1.14 (Google Play)
- Device: Samsung Galaxy S10e (SM-G970U)
- OS: Android 10, stock ROM
- Vault encrypted: Yes (with biometric unlock)
- Reproducible: Always (when "show password" is checked)

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- The app logic does not enforce password confirmation when the "show password" box is checked during setup.

Fix/Resolution:
- The issue is a duplicate of #309 and was closed as completed.
