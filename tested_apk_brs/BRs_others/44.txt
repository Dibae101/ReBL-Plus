Bug Report Title: Tag text removal bug when using checkbox

Issue Description:
When removing a tag by unchecking its checkbox, the app removes all tags that share the same header as the deleted tag, instead of just the selected tag. For example, unchecking the tag "#test" also removes tags like "#testa" and "#testb", which should remain.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the plus (+) button to add a new note.
2. Select "textnote".
3. Click the title field and type "tag".
4. Click the content field and type: #testA #testB #test
5. Click the back arrow to save the note.
6. Re-open the note by clicking on it.
7. Click on the tag at the top bar.
8. Click the "test" tag.
9. Click OK.
10. Observe that all tags containing "test" (e.g., "#testA", "#testB") are also removed (bug: all similar tags are deleted).

Expected Behavior:
- Only the selected tag (e.g., "#test") should be removed. Tags with similar headers (e.g., "#testa", "#testb") should remain.

Actual Behavior:
- All tags that contain the same header as the deleted tag are removed, not just the selected tag.

Environment:
- App version: 5.2.2
- Device: Nokia 7 Plus
- OS: Android 9.0.0
- Reproducible: Always

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- The tag removal logic matches and deletes all tags containing the header string, rather than matching the exact tag.

Fix/Resolution:
- The issue was fixed by updating the tag removal logic to only remove the selected tag.
