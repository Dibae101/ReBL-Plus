App Name: Firefox Focus (mozilla-mobile/focus-android)

Bug Report Title: App crashes when clicking notification item to delete history

Issue Description:
When the user attempts to delete browsing history by tapping the 'delete browsing history' notification item, the app crashes due to a NullPointerException in the SessionNotificationService. This occurs when the app is in the background and the notification action is triggered.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any website in Firefox Focus.
2. Press the home button to minimize the app (send it to the background).
3. Pull down the notification shade.
4. Tap the 'delete browsing history' text in the notification item.

Expected Behavior:
- The app should open (if needed) and delete the browsing history without crashing.

Actual Behavior:
- The app crashes with a NullPointerException. Stack trace excerpt:
  java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke direct method 'void org.mozilla.focus.session.VisibilityLifeCycleCallback.finishAndRemoveTaskIfInBackground()' on a null object reference
  at org.mozilla.focus.session.VisibilityLifeCycleCallback.finishAndRemoveTaskIfInBackground(VisibilityLifeCycleCallback.java:28)
  at org.mozilla.focus.session.SessionNotificationService.onStartCommand(SessionNotificationService.java:70)
  ...

Environment:
- Observed on both simulator and physical device
- Affected version: (not specified in issue, but likely 2018-era release)

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- The crash is caused by a null reference to VisibilityLifeCycleCallback in SessionNotificationService when handling the notification action in the background.

Fix/Resolution:
- The issue was fixed by ensuring VisibilityLifeCycleCallback is properly assigned before use. See PR #2503 and commit e453566.
