App Name: Firefox Focus for Android

Bug Report Title: The trashcan icon is moving with the keyboard when having more than 1 tab open

Issue ID: 4617

Issue Description:
When more than one tab is open in Firefox Focus, the trashcan (erase) icon appears above the keyboard and moves with it when the keyboard is shown. This is visually distracting and not the intended behavior, as the icon should not be displayed above the keyboard.

Environment:
- Device: Pixel 2
- OS: Android 9
- App Version: Focus 8.7.2 (Build ID: 342410345 GV 80.0.20200827204751)
- Reproducible: Yes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox Focus and visit google.com.
2. Long tap on "Images" and choose "Open link in new tab" (so that more than one tab is open).
3. Tap on the Google input field to bring up the keyboard.
4. Observe the trashcan icon above the keyboard.

Expected Behavior:
The trashcan icon should not be displayed above the keyboard when the keyboard is shown.

Observed Behavior:
The trashcan icon is displayed above the keyboard and moves with it.

Root Cause (if known):
The floating button visibility logic did not properly hide the trashcan icon (and other floating buttons) when the keyboard was shown, especially when multiple floating buttons were present. The fix involved updating the delegate view logic to handle multiple views and ensure all floating buttons are hidden when the keyboard appears.
