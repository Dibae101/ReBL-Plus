App Name: Amaze File Manager

Bug Report Title: Tab find database query fails and loads home directory sometimes

Issue ID: 2010

Issue Description:
When starting Amaze File Manager, the app sometimes fails to restore the last opened paths in both tabs. Instead, due to a database query failure, both tabs load the home directory. This issue occurs randomly and disrupts the expected session restore behavior.

Environment:
- App Version: (not specified, but issue reported on recent versions)
- Device: OnePlus 6T (example)
- OS: (not specified)
- Reproducible: Sometimes (random occurrence)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open random paths in both tabs in Amaze File Manager.
2. Exit the app.
3. Reopen Amaze File Manager.
4. Sometimes, the app opens with the correct last opened paths, but other times it fails and loads the home directory in both tabs.

Expected Behavior:
Amaze File Manager should always restore the last opened path in both tabs upon startup.

Observed Behavior:
Occasionally, the app fails to restore the last opened paths and loads the home directory in both tabs due to a database query failure.

Root Cause (if known):
A database query for the last opened tab path sometimes returns an empty result set, causing the app to default to the home directory. The fix involved replacing clear DB calls with an update on load list and removing redundant code.
