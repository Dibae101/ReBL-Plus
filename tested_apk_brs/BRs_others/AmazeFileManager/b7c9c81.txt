App Name: Amaze File Manager

Bug Report Title: "Up" button on settings always goes to the main settings page

Issue ID: 2477

Issue Description:
When navigating through nested settings in Amaze File Manager, pressing the "up" button (usually the arrow in the top left) always returns the user to the main settings page, rather than going up one level in the settings hierarchy. This breaks expected navigation and makes it harder to backtrack through sub-settings.

Environment:
- App Version: (not specified, but issue reported on recent versions)
- Device: (not specified)
- OS: (not specified)
- Reproducible: Yes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Amaze debug App.
2. Click on Hamburger icon and scroll up go to settings
3. Navigate into a sub-settings page (e.g., Color Preferences).
4. Press the "up" button in the top left.
5. Observe that you are returned to the main settings page, not the previous sub-settings page.

Expected Behavior:
Pressing the "up" button should go up one level in the settings hierarchy, returning to the previous sub-settings page, not directly to the main settings page.

Observed Behavior:
Pressing the "up" button always returns to the main settings page, regardless of the current depth in the settings hierarchy.

Root Cause (if known):
The ID of the "up" button was not handled correctly in the ColorPref.onOptionsItemSelected() method, causing navigation to always go to the main settings page. The fix restores the previous behavior, allowing the "up" button to go up one level.
