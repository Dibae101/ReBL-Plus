App Name: Amaze File Manager

Bug Report Title: Runtime permission denial for storage makes trouble

Issue ID: 1866

Issue Description:
When the user denies storage permission by clicking "Deny & Don't Ask Again" in the runtime permission dialog, the app continuously shows "Permission not granted" toast messages. These toast messages continue to appear even after the user exits the app, as the queued toasts keep displaying on the screen until they all finish showing.

Environment:
- App Version: 3.4.3
- Device: Nokia 7 Plus
- OS: Android 10
- Rooted: No
- Reproducible: Yes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Amaze File Manager for the first time (or after clicking "Deny & Don't Ask Again").
2. When the runtime permission dialog appears, click "Deny & Don't Ask Again".
3. Stay on the screen for a few seconds.
4. Exit the app manually.
5. Observe that toast messages continue to appear even after the app is closed.

Expected Behavior:
When the user denies permission, the app should show a single dialog explaining why storage permission is needed, with options to either allow (navigating to settings) or exit the app. The app should not spam toast messages continuously.

Observed Behavior:
The app continuously shows "Permission not granted" toast messages, which continue to appear even after exiting the app because multiple toasts are queued and cannot finish displaying while the app is open.

Root Cause (if known):
The permission request denial handling continuously triggered toast messages without proper control or rate limiting. The fix properly handles permission denial for Android M+ devices.
