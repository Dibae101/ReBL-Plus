App Name: GPSTest

Bug Report Title: Logging resets on portrait/landscape mode change

Issue Description:
When file logging is enabled, changing the device orientation between portrait and landscape causes a new log file to be created. This results in multiple log files for a single session, making it difficult to track continuous logging data.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch GPSTest with file logging enabled.
2. Click "Allow all the time" for location permission if prompted.
3. Click "close" on any popups.
4. Click the hamburger menu and go to "Settings".
5. Scroll to the bottom and click "Logging and output".
6. Click "NMEA" and "allow" if prompted.
7. Click the back button twice to return to the main screen.
8. Click the hamburger menu and select "Accuracy".
9. Rotate the device from portrait to landscape.
10. Observe that an information bubble states a new logging file is created (bug: logging resets on orientation change).

Expected Behavior:
- Logging should continue in the same file regardless of orientation changes.

Actual Behavior:
- A new log file is created each time the device orientation changes.

Environment:
- App version: (not specified)
- Device: Pixel 4
- OS: Android 10
- Reproducible: Always

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- The app creates a new log file on each orientation change due to how logging is handled during activity recreation.

Fix/Resolution:
- The issue was fixed by reusing the log file on orientation change. See commit af19685c439a3158b1c5d99581919349bcfd9ae9 and 4e7a653a2d8bdf8d62a26d9edb4b043bed532432.
