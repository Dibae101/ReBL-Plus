Bug Report Title:
Typing contacts in new message screen - search text not cleared after contact selection

Bug Report Issue:
When creating a new message and typing to search for a contact, the search text remains in the input field after selecting a contact. This leaves both the contact chip and the partial search text in the recipient field, creating a cluttered and confusing UI.

### DESCRIPTION
In the new message composition screen, when users type a contact's name to search and then select the contact from the suggestions, the typed search text is not cleared from the input field. Instead, both the selected contact (displayed as a chip/bubble) and the partial text that was typed remain visible in the recipient field. This creates confusion about who the message will be sent to and clutters the interface.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open QKSMS app
2. Tap the "+" (plus) button to create a new message thread
3. In the recipient field, start typing the first few letters of a contact's name (e.g., type "1")
4. From the contact suggestions that appear, click to select any listed contact
5. Observe the recipient field

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
After selecting a contact from the search results:
- The search text should be cleared from the input field
- Only the selected contact should appear (typically as a chip/bubble with the contact's name)
- The input field should be ready for the user to either type another recipient or move to the message composition area
- The interface should be clean and uncluttered

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
After selecting a contact:
- The selected contact appears as a chip/bubble in the recipient field
- The partial search text (e.g., "Joh") remains visible in the input field alongside the contact chip
- The recipient field displays both the contact chip and the typed text
- This creates a confusing UI where it's unclear what will happen with the remaining text
- Additionally, users report that there doesn't seem to be a way to type a message after selecting a contact, suggesting the focus or input handling may also be affected

### ENVIRONMENT
QKSMS version: Not specified (issue reported May 2018)
Android version: Various
Device: Multiple devices

### ROOT CAUSE
The search/filter text in the recipient input field is not being cleared after a contact is selected from the suggestions. The code that handles contact selection likely adds the contact chip but fails to clear the text input field or reset the search query.

### IMPACT
- Creates a confusing and cluttered UI
- May prevent users from typing messages after selecting contacts
- Users may be unsure if the message will be sent to the intended recipient
- Degrades the user experience for message composition

### FIX
Clear the search text from the input field after a contact is selected. Ensure that:
1. When a contact is selected from suggestions, the text input is cleared
2. Focus is properly managed to allow message composition
3. The recipient field only shows the selected contact chips
