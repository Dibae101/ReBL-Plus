App Name: Aegis Authenticator

Bug Report Title: App crashes when code refresh time is set to 9999 seconds

Issue Description:
When creating a new manual entry and setting the code refresh time to 9999 seconds, the app instantly crashes. After the crash, reopening the app and entering the password causes it to crash again repeatedly, making the app unusable until data is cleared.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tap the plus (+) button to add a new entry.
2. Select "Enter manually".
3. In the time/period field, enter "9999" seconds as the code refresh time.
4. Fill in other required fields (e.g., secret: "test").
5. Tap save.
6. The app instantly crashes (bug: crash on saving entry with 9999s refresh time).
7. Reopen Aegis and enter the password; the app crashes again and again until app data is cleared.

Expected Behavior:
- The app should accept large code refresh times and generate codes as expected, or validate and reject unsupported values with a user-friendly error.

Actual Behavior:
- The app crashes instantly when saving an entry with a 9999s refresh time, and continues to crash on subsequent launches until data is cleared.

Environment:
- App version: 1.2 (F-Droid)
- Device: Pixel
- OS: Android 10 (AndroR2 metadata: Android 7.1.1)
- Vault encrypted: Yes
- Reproducible: Always

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- The crash is due to a division by zero or improper handling of large period values when calculating code progress.

Fix/Resolution:
- The issue was fixed in PR #504 ("Fix division by zero when calculating progress for large periods").
