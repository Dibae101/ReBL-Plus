App Name: ATimeTracker

Bug Report Title: Long press on a task does not show the task menu

Issue Description:
When long-pressing a task to edit its times, the expected menu does not appear. Instead, an empty pop-up called "activities menu" is shown. This prevents users from accessing options like "show times" and "edit times" for the task. The issue is more pronounced for entries at the top of the list, while the menu is scrollable for entries further down, but still not fully usable.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the menu.
2. Click "add activity".
3. Click the name field and type a name.
4. Click "add activity" to create the task.
5. Click the task to start the timer.
6. Long-press the task.
7. Observe that the menu is empty or not fully visible (bug: long-press does not show the expected task menu).

Expected Behavior:
- Long-pressing a task should display a menu with options to show and edit times, allowing users to manage their tasks.

Actual Behavior:
- An empty "activities menu" is shown, and the expected options are not accessible. For entries at the top, the menu is not fully visible; for entries further down, the menu is scrollable but still not fully usable.

Environment:
- App version: 0.51.1
- Devices: Huawei P10 (Android 8.0.0), Xiaomi A2 (Android One Pie)
- Reproducible: Always on Android 7 and later; works as expected on Android 6.

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- The context menu does not overlap the anchor correctly on Android 7 and later, causing display issues. See related StackOverflow discussions for context menu bugs in Android 7+.

Fix/Resolution:
- The issue was fixed by specifying that the context menu should overlap the anchor. See commit 394ccfc0c04223a263411e8af4487458e848d319.
