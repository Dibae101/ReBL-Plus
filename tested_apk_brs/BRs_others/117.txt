App Name: Open Food Facts

Bug Report Title:
Space increase on refresh in Nutrition Facts tab

Bug Report Issue:
In the Nutrition Facts tab, the vertical spacing between each row of nutritional values increases every time the user performs a swipe-to-refresh action. This causes the layout to progressively become more spaced out with each refresh.

### DESCRIPTION
When viewing a food item's Nutrition Facts tab, using the swipe-to-refresh gesture causes the spacing between each nutritional value row to increase. Each subsequent refresh adds more space, causing the layout to become progressively more spread out and less compact. This is a cumulative UI bug where the spacing compounds with each refresh action.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open OpenFoodFacts app
2. Search for any food (eg. milk) select any food item from the list
3. Navigate to the "Nutrition Facts" tab of that item
4. Swipe down to perform a refresh (swipe-to-refresh gesture)
5. Observe that the spacing between nutritional value rows increases
6. Swipe down again to refresh
7. Notice that the spacing increases even more with each refresh

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
Refreshing the Nutrition Facts tab should only update the nutritional data displayed. The layout and spacing between rows should remain consistent and unchanged, regardless of how many times the user refreshes the page.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
Each time the user performs a swipe-to-refresh action, the vertical space between each row of nutritional values increases. The spacing compounds with multiple refreshes, making the layout progressively more spread out. The data may refresh correctly, but the visual layout becomes distorted with excessive spacing.

### ENVIRONMENT
Open Food Facts version: Not specified (issue reported Jan 2019)
Android version: Android Oreo (8.1)
Device: Xiaomi Redmi Note 5
ROM: Custom ROM

### VISUAL DEMONSTRATION
The issue is clearly visible in the animated GIF provided in the original issue report, showing the spacing progressively increasing with each refresh action.

### ROOT CAUSE
The layout mechanism for the Nutrition Facts tab is not properly resetting or clearing previous layout constraints when refreshing. The spacing/padding is likely being added cumulatively instead of being reset to the original values before redrawing the UI.

### FIX
Ensure that the layout is properly reset or cleared before refreshing the nutritional data. The layout constraints and spacing should be recalculated from scratch on each refresh rather than being added to existing values.
