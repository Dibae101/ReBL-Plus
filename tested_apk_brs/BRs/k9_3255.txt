App Name: K-9 Mail

Bug Report Title:
App crashes with invalid format email address

Bug Report Issue:
K-9 Mail crashes when user tries to add an email account with an invalid top-level domain format like "foo@b.2".

### DESCRIPTION
The app doesn't validate email hostname format properly, causing a crash when encountering invalid TLDs like ".2".

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open K-9 Mail app
2. Tap to add new email account
3. Enter email address "foo@b.2" (or any email with invalid TLD)
4. Enter password
5. Press "Manually" or "Continue" button
6. App crashes with "K-9 Mail has stopped"

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
The app should show an error message like "Invalid email address format" instead of crashing.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
App crashes when trying to validate or process the email address with an invalid TLD.

### ENVIRONMENT
K-9 Mail version: 5.403
Android version: 6.0.1
Device: Various

### NOTE
Internal email addresses with custom TLDs like ".2" work in Thunderbird but are technically invalid per DNS standards.


Comments:
Comment#1:
`.2` is invalid and will never be valid as far as I understand IDNs application to TLDs.

I don't see value in K-9 supporting the defederation of email like this. I also don't see Thunderbird on its own as a good enough reason to ignore that. I suspect Thunderbird is lack of validation not choice to support this. So it's not a feature to have parity with, more exploitation  of a design flaw.

But we shouldn't crash.

Comment#2:
We use Java's `URI` class for `storeUri`. Temporarily we set the hostname part to "mail.b.2" which the `URI` class doesn't like. For hostnames it only accepts the following format (minus the trailing dot):

```java
// hostname      = domainlabel [ "." ] | 1*( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
// domainlabel   = alphanum | alphanum *( alphanum | "-" | "_" ) alphanum
// toplabel      = alpha | alpha *( alphanum | "-" | "_" ) alphanum
```
We should change `EmailAddressValidator.EMAIL_ADDRESS_PATTERN` to only accept such hostnames.
