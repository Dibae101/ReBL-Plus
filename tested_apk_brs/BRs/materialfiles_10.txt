App Name: Material Files (MaterialFiles)

Bug Report Title:
FTP server restarts after being stopped when the app is closed/killed

Bug Report Issue:
After stopping the built-in FTP server in Material Files and then closing/killing the app, the FTP server starts again on its own without the user re-enabling it.  ￼

DESCRIPTION

If the user starts the FTP server, stops it, and then closes/kills the app, the FTP server should remain stopped. Instead, it restarts automatically.  ￼

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
	1.	Open Material Files and grant file access permissions (“Allow”) if prompted.  ￼
	2.	Open the app menu → tap FTP server.  ￼
	3.	Tap Start server.  ￼
	4.	Tap Stop server.  ￼
	5.  Open the Recent apps / Overview screen (Android “square” button or gesture).
	6.  Find Material Files in the recent apps list.
	7.  Swipe the Material Files card away (left/right or up, depending on Android UI) to dismiss it.
	8.  Confirm Material Files is no longer visible in the Recent apps list.
	9.  The FTP server will remain running

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

After the user stops the FTP server and closes/kills the app, the FTP server should remain stopped until the user manually starts it again.  ￼

ACTUAL BEHAVIOR

After closing/killing the app, the FTP server restarts by itself.  ￼
