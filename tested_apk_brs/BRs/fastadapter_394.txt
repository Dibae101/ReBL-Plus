App Name: FastAdapter Sample App

Bug Report Title:
App crashes when clicking GenericItem sample

Bug Report Issue:
The FastAdapter sample app crashes with NullPointerException when user taps on the GenericItem sample menu option.

### DESCRIPTION
The app attempts to call recycle() on a null TypedArray object, indicating improper null handling when obtaining styled attributes.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Launch FastAdapter sample app (version 2.5.1)
2. Navigate to the main menu/list of samples
3. Click on "GenericItem" sample option
4. App crashes immediately with NullPointerException

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
The GenericItem sample screen should open and display the example implementation.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
App crashes with NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'void android.content.res.TypedArray.recycle()' on a null object reference at line 69.

### ENVIRONMENT
FastAdapter version: 2.5.1 (Play Store)
Android version: Various
Device: Various

Crash Details:
- Exception Type: java.lang.NullPointerException
- Error Message: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'void android.content.res.TypedArray.recycle()' on a null object reference
- Location: Line 69 (likely in GenericItem class or related layout inflation code)
- Version: FastAdapter 2.5.1 (Play Store version)

Stack Trace:
```
java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'void android.content.res.TypedArray.recycle()' on a null object reference
    at [GenericItem or related class]:69
```

Technical Analysis:
The issue is caused by improper null handling when obtaining styled attributes. The typical pattern that causes this:
```java
TypedArray a = context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, R.styleable.Something);
// ... use attributes ...
a.recycle(); // crashes here if obtainStyledAttributes returned null
```

The fix should add null checking before calling recycle():
```java
TypedArray a = context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, R.styleable.Something);
if (a != null) {
    // ... use attributes ...
    a.recycle();
}
```

Or ensure that obtainStyledAttributes() is called with valid parameters that guarantee a non-null return.

Impact:
- Severity: High - Complete crash when accessing feature
- Frequency: 100% reproduction rate in version 2.5.1
- Affected Component: GenericItem sample
- User Impact: Users cannot view or test the GenericItem implementation in the sample app

Resolution:
This issue was fixed by maintainer mikepenz in commit d12f4f2 on April 17, 2017, one day after the issue was reported. The issue is now closed as completed.
