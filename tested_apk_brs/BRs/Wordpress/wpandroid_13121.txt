### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
The countries map should display a geographical visualization showing visitor statistics by country, with different colors or shading representing the data from different regions.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
The countries map image is completely blank and displays only white color, regardless of the selected Appearance settings (light, dark, or system default). No country data or map visualization is shown.

### ENVIRONMENT
WordPress for Android version: 15.9-rc-1, 15.9-rc-2
Android version: 10, 11
Device: Pixel 3, Pixel 4

### NOTE
