App Name: NewPipe

Bug Report Title:
Back button does nothing on Error Report page

Bug Report Issue:
When the app fails to connect to the server and displays an error report page, the back button in the navbar does not work, preventing users from returning to the previous screen.

### DESCRIPTION
The Error Report page in NewPipe does not properly handle the back button navigation. When users encounter a network error and navigate to the error report page, clicking the back button on the navigation bar has no effect, leaving users stuck on the error page with no way to return to the previous screen.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open NewPipe app
2. Disconnect network/internet connection so that the app cannot connect to the server
3. Wait for the loading to finish
4. Click on the "Report" button when error appears
5. On the Error Report page, click the back button in the navbar
6. Observe the app behavior

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
The app should navigate back to the last page that was displayed before clicking on the Report button. The back button should function normally and allow users to exit the Error Report page.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
The app does nothing when the back button is pressed. Users remain stuck on the Error Report page with no way to navigate back through normal back button interaction.

### ENVIRONMENT
NewPipe version: 0.21.2
Android version: Android 11
Device: Google Pixel 3a

### NOTE
This issue affects user experience by trapping users on the error report page. The only workaround is likely to use the system back button or close the app entirely.

Fixed in PR #6312 - "Fix ErrorActivity actionbar back button not working"
The fix addressed the issue by properly implementing the back button functionality in the ErrorActivity's action bar.
