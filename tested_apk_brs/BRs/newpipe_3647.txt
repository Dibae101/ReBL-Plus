App Name: NewPipe

Bug Report Title:
Reporting bug through email does not attach exception details to email body

Bug Report Issue:
When reporting a bug through email, the exception details are not included in the email body. Users need to manually copy and paste the report content or use the share button as a workaround.

### DESCRIPTION
The bug report email functionality in NewPipe fails to properly populate the email body with the actual exception details and crash information. When users attempt to report a bug by selecting the email option from the error report screen, the email client opens but the body remains empty or does not contain the critical debugging information that should be automatically included.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open NewPipe app
2. click on "Report"
3. Scroll down and select the option to "report this error via email"
4. Choose an email client (e.g., Gmail)
5. Observe that the email body does not contain the exception details

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
When selecting the email option to report a bug:
- The email client should open with pre-filled recipients (NewPipe bug report email addresses)
- The email body should contain all the exception details, stack trace, device information, and other relevant debugging data
- Users should only need to add optional comments before sending

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
When reporting via email:
- The email client opens but the exception details are not included in the email body
- The critical debugging information is missing from the email
- Users must manually copy and paste the report content

### ENVIRONMENT
NewPipe version: Not specified (issue reported May 2020)
Android version: Not specified
Email client: Gmail (primarily affected)

### WORKAROUND
An alternative workaround exists:
1. Click the top-left share button on the error report screen
2. Choose 'email' from the share options
3. This method successfully puts the content in the email's body
4. However, it does not pre-fill the recipient email addresses for bug reporting

### NOTE
The issue appears to be email client specific - it used to work for Gmail and still works for Outlook. The functionality works correctly in some email clients but fails in others.

It used to work for Gmail and it still works for Outlook. Anyway, I've already fixed this in PR #3580.
