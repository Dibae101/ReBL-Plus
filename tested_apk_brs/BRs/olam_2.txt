App: Olam (Malayalam Dictionary)

Bug Report Title: Force close when searching with apostrophe

Description:
The app crashes when searching for any word containing an apostrophe character. The unescaped apostrophe breaks SQL query syntax, causing SQLiteException. This is a SQL injection vulnerability.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Olam Malayalam Dictionary app
2. In search field, type a word with apostrophe (e.g., "word's" or "slumdroid's test")
3. App crashes immediately with SQLiteException

Expected Behavior:
App should escape special characters or use parameterized queries. Search should complete without crashing, showing results or "no results found".

Actual Behavior:
App crashes in AsyncTask with "near 's': syntax error". Unescaped apostrophe in SQL LIKE clause breaks query.

Crash: SQLiteException - near "s": syntax error (code 1) in DatabaseHelper.getSimilarStems(DatabaseHelper.java:115)

Environment:
- Package: com.olam
- Thread: AsyncTask #1

Technical Analysis:
The bug is in DatabaseHelper.java at line 115 in the getSimilarStems() method. The code uses SQLiteDatabase.rawQuery() with string concatenation to build the SQL query, which is vulnerable to SQL injection and special character issues. The fix should use parameterized queries (prepared statements) with '?' placeholders, or escape the apostrophe by replacing it with two apostrophes ('').

Impact:
- Severity: High - Complete app crash
- Frequency: Every time a word with apostrophe is entered
- Affected Component: Search functionality
- User Impact: Users cannot search for possessive forms or contractions (common in many languages)

Note: According to a comment from maintainer tapanprakasht on Feb 21, 2016, this issue was reproducible only in the Play Store version and has been fixed in the current repository, though the issue remains open.
