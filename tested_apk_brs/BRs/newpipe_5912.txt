Bug Report Title:
Text copied from HTML is rendered in search bar

Bug Report Issue:
When visually formatted text (bold, italic, underline, superscript, subscript) is copied from a web browser and pasted into the NewPipe search bar, the formatting is preserved and rendered instead of being converted to plain text.

### DESCRIPTION
The search bar in NewPipe does not properly strip rich text formatting when users paste content copied from web browsers. When copying text with HTML formatting from a browser (such as underlined text, bold words, superscript numbers, or subscript text), the visual formatting is preserved and rendered in the search bar instead of being converted to plain text. For example, if you copy "This is some mispeled text" where "mispeled" and "text" are underlined in the browser, the underlines appear in the search bar as well. This creates visual inconsistency and makes the search input difficult to read and use properly.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome Mobile)
2. Search for or navigate to a page with HTML formatting examples (e.g., search "HTML underline tag example")
3. Find text that has formatting applied, such as:
   - Underlined text (e.g., "This is some mispeled text" where "mispeled" is underlined)
   - Superscript text (e.g., "x²" with the 2 as superscript)
   - Subscript text (e.g., "H₂O" with the 2 as subscript)
   - Bold or italic text
4. Select and copy the formatted text from the browser (including the underlined/formatted portions)
5. Open NewPipe app
6. Tap on the search bar
7. Long press and paste the copied text
8. Observe that the formatting (underline, superscript, etc.) is preserved in the search bar

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
When HTML formatted text is pasted into the search bar:
- The text should be automatically converted to plain text
- All HTML formatting should be stripped
- Only the raw text content should appear in the search bar
- The text should display uniformly without special formatting
- Search functionality should work with the plain text content

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
When formatted text is pasted into the search bar:
- The HTML/rich text formatting from the browser is preserved and rendered in the search bar
- Underlined text remains underlined (e.g., copying "This is some mispeled text" with underline shows up with the underline in the search bar)
- Superscript and subscript text displays with elevated or lowered positioning
- Bold and italic formatting remains visible
- The search bar displays text with mixed formatting styles instead of uniform plain text
- As shown in the screenshot, the search bar title shows "This is some mispeled text" with "mispeled" and "text" appearing underlined
- This creates visual clutter and inconsistency in the search input field

### ENVIRONMENT
NewPipe version: 0.20.11
Android version: Android 11
Device: Samsung S20 FE
Browser tested: Chrome Mobile

### VISUAL DEMONSTRATION
Screenshots provided in the original issue show:
1. The search bar displaying "This is some mispeled text" in the title bar with visible underline formatting on "mispeled" and "text"
2. The formatted text being rendered with HTML styling instead of appearing as plain text
3. The underline formatting from the copied browser text is preserved in the NewPipe search interface

### ROOT CAUSE
The search EditText field accepts rich text formatting from the clipboard without stripping it. The field needs to be configured to only accept plain text input or implement a paste handler that converts rich text to plain text before insertion.


Comments:
Comment#1:
Issue was fixed in PR #6353 - "Fix unwanted rich text formatting when pasting"
---
Comment#2:
The fix added formatting removal on paste for search functionality, ensuring that only plain text is pasted into the search bar regardless of the source formatting.
