Issue_Number: 1821
Status: FAIL / NOT REPRODUCED
Duration_Seconds: 523.603004
Total_Commands: 26
GPT_Responses: 30
Bug_Reproduced: No
Failure_Reason: Blocked — Settings page not scrollable in this run. All attempts to scroll/swipe/scroll End, orientation changes, and leaving/re-entering Settings failed to reveal the required Display → Theme (or Anti-Features) preference dialog, so the prerequisite step (“open PreferenceDialogFragmentCompat then rotate”) could not be reached.
Log_File: N/A
Remarks: Reached F-Droid → Settings successfully, but UI automation could not scroll the preferences list (UI content stayed the same across multiple scroll/swipe/orientation attempts).
