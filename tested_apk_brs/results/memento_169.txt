Issue_Number: 169
Status: FAIL / NOT REPRODUCED
Duration_Seconds: 608.457818
Total_Commands: 25
GPT_Responses: 25
Bug_Reproduced: No
Failure_Reason: Could not reach the required invalid date state (e.g., Feb 30/31) because the date-picker wheels were not exposed in the UI dump; swipe actions produced no observable state change, and after pressing SET the app returned normally to AddBirthdayActivity with a normal date (e.g., “December 24, 2025”) instead of crashing.
Log_File: N/A
Reproduction_Attempt_Steps_Executed (high level):
Launcher → Memento Calendar
Tap + (add) → AddBirthdayActivity
Tap Birthday to open date picker
Tap Include year? (attempted toggle)
Multiple “blind” swipes (left/right/up) to try setting an invalid date per BR methods
Tap SET to confirm date
Returned to AddBirthdayActivity without crash; date shown remained valid (e.g., “December 24 / December 24, 2025”)
Remarks:
This run contains no crash indicator (no “has stopped”, no launcher return).
The failure is specifically due to non-observable date changes (picker internals not represented in the UI info), making it impossible to verify or reliably set the invalid date required by the bug report.
