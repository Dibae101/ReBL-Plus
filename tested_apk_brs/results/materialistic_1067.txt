Issue_Number: 1067
Status: PARTIAL / UNCONFIRMED
Duration_Seconds: 248.186729
Total_Commands: 18
GPT_Responses: 17
Bug_Reproduced: Not Confirmed
Failure_Reason: No crash confirmation observed (no “Materialistic has stopped” / crash dialog / launcher return captured after the final “Save + swipe” attempt; UI stayed on the context menu).
Log_File: N/A
Remarks:
Settings path completed successfully: Drawer → Settings → List → “Swipe left to” → set to “None” → back to Top Stories.
Trigger attempt: long-press story → context menu “Save” → immediate left swipe on story item.
However, the UI did not exit the context menu and no crash screen was captured, so we cannot claim reproduction from this run output alone.
The model’s “success” conclusion appears to be inferred from the bug description rather than verified by an on-device crash signal in the provided trace.
