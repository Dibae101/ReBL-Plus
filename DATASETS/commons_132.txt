App Name: Commons

Bug Report Title:
App crashes when attempting to login with invalid credentials

Bug Report Issue:
The Commons app crashes immediately when a user attempts to log in with random or invalid email and password credentials. Instead of displaying an error message about incorrect login details, the application terminates unexpectedly.

### DESCRIPTION
When users try to authenticate using the login screen with any random email address and password combination, the app does not handle the invalid credentials gracefully. Rather than showing an authentication error message or validation feedback, the application crashes completely, preventing users from attempting to log in again or correcting their credentials.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open Commons app
2. On the welcome/login screen, locate the login fields
3. Enter a random email address (e.g., "test@example.com")
4. Enter a random password (e.g., "randompass123")
5. Tap the "Login" or "Sign In" button
6. App crashes immediately

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
When invalid credentials are entered, the app should:
- Attempt to authenticate with the server
- Receive an authentication failure response
- Display a user-friendly error message indicating invalid credentials
- Allow the user to retry login with corrected credentials
- Not crash or close unexpectedly

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
The app crashes immediately upon attempting to log in with invalid credentials. No error message is displayed, and the user is forced out of the application. The crash occurs before any proper error handling can inform the user of the authentication failure.

### ENVIRONMENT
Commons version: APK 132
Android version: Various
Device: Multiple devices

### ROOT CAUSE
Likely causes include:
- Missing null/error handling in the authentication response processing
- Unhandled exception when the server returns an authentication error
- Attempting to parse or process a null/error response without proper checks
- NullPointerException when accessing user data that doesn't exist after failed authentication
- Missing try-catch blocks around the login API call or response handling

### IMPACT
This is a critical bug that prevents users from logging in to the app. Users who mistype their credentials or attempt to use the app for the first time with incorrect information will experience immediate crashes, creating a poor user experience and blocking access to the application.

### FIX
Add proper error handling for authentication failures:
1. Wrap authentication API calls in try-catch blocks
2. Check for null responses and error states from the authentication server
3. Display appropriate error messages for failed login attempts
4. Ensure the UI remains functional after authentication failures
5. Add input validation before making authentication requests
