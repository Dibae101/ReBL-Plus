App Name: StreetComplete

Bug Report Title: Cursor jumps before housenumber when adding letter

Issue Description:
When entering a housenumber that includes a letter (e.g., "10a") in the housenumber task, the cursor unexpectedly jumps to the beginning of the input field after typing the number and pressing the letter button. As a result, the letter is inserted before the number (e.g., "a10" instead of "10a").

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select the housenumber task in StreetComplete.
2. Enter a housenumber, e.g., type "10".
3. Press the letter button to add a letter (e.g., "a").
4. Observe the cursor position and the resulting input.
5. The cursor jumps to the beginning of the input field, so the letter is inserted before the number (e.g., "a10").


Expected Behavior:
- The cursor should remain at the end of the input field so that new input is appended to the end (e.g., "10a").

Actual Behavior:
- The cursor jumps to the beginning of the input field, so the letter is inserted before the number (e.g., "a10").

Environment:
- App version: 5.2
- Android version: 6.0.1
- Reproducible: Always (also occurred in older versions)

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- Not specified in the issue, but likely related to input field or keyboard handling logic.

Fix/Resolution:
- The issue was fixed in commit 35880e3bc7b482dcf44ebf6398eb0226064d9ad6.
