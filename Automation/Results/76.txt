App Name: Firefox Focus for Android

Bug Report Title: When interchanging app's languages the app's homescreen is not updated with correct translation

Issue ID: 4583

Issue Description:
When changing the app's language from the settings, the homescreen does not update the text below the Firefox Focus logo to the selected language. The translation only appears after closing and reopening the app. The same issue occurs with the "Search suggestions" dialog box for certain languages (e.g., Aragones, Español (Mexico), Italian).

Environment:
- Device: Sony Xperia Z5
- OS: Android 7
- App Version: Focus 8.5.0 with GV: 78
- Reproducible: Yes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox Focus for Android.
2. Go to Menu > Settings > General > Language.
3. Choose a different language.
4. Return to the app's homescreen.

Expected Behavior:
The text below the Firefox Focus logo (and in the "Search suggestions" dialog) should be immediately translated to the chosen language.

Observed Behavior:
The text remains in the previous language. Only after closing and reopening the app does the translation appear.

Root Cause (if known):
Not specified in the issue. The problem is likely due to the UI not refreshing the translation after a language change until the app restarts.
