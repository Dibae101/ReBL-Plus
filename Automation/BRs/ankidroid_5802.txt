Issue Summary: Wrong symbol displayed for ascending/descending sorting in card browser - the arrow direction is inverted.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the AnkiDroid app
2. Tap on "Card Browser" to open the card browser
3. Tap on the menu icon (three dots) in the top right corner
4. Select "Change display order" from the menu
5. Observe the symbol/arrow displayed next to the current sort selection
6. Note the actual sorting order of the cards (e.g., A to Z or Z to A)

Expected Result: When cards are sorted in descending order (Z to A, largest to smallest), a downward-pointing triangle should be displayed. When cards are sorted in ascending order (A to Z, smallest to largest), an upward-pointing triangle should be displayed. The triangle direction should match the sorting direction.

Actual Result: The triangle symbol is inverted. When the sort field is sorted Z to A (descending order), the triangle points upward (ascending symbol). When sorted A to Z (ascending order), the triangle points downward (descending symbol). The visual indicator contradicts the actual sorting behavior.

Additional Notes: This is a UI inconsistency where the sort direction indicator does not match the actual sorting behavior. The triangle should be thought of as a visual mnemonic of the current state - a triangle pointing down represents descending order (largest/base at top, smallest/point at bottom), and a triangle pointing up represents ascending order (smallest/point at top, largest/base at bottom). Initial fix attempt in PR #6326 did not fully resolve the issue.
