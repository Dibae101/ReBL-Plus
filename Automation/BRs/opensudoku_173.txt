App: OpenSudoku

Bug Report Title: Crash when rotating device after deleting puzzle

Description:
App crashes with NullPointerException when device is rotated after deleting a puzzle. The deleted game reference is still accessed during activity recreation after configuration change.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start OpenSudoku app
2. Select any difficulty level
3. Long-click a game in the list
4. Select "Edit note" from context menu
5. Click Cancel on dialog
6. Long-click same game again
7. Select "Delete puzzle" from context menu
8. Click "OK" to confirm deletion
9. Rotate the device
10. App crashes

Expected Behavior:
App should handle configuration change gracefully after deletion, cleaning up deleted game references and restoring activity state without crashing.

Actual Behavior:
App crashes when restoring dialog state during activity recreation. The onPrepareDialog method tries to access null game variable at SudokuListActivity.java:333.

Crash: NullPointerException at cz.romario.opensudoku.gui.SudokuListActivity.onPrepareDialog(SudokuListActivity.java:333)

Environment:
- Package: cz.romario.opensudoku
- Version: 1.1.5
- Device: Nexus 4
- Android Version: 4.2

Fix Suggestion:
Add null check before accessing the game variable in onPrepareDialog method to handle cases where the game has been deleted before dialog restoration.
