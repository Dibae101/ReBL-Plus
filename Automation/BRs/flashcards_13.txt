App Name: FlashCards (ASU CodeDevils)

Bug Report Title:
App crashes when creating a new course

Bug Report Issue:
FlashCards app crashes on fresh installation when user tries to create a new course due to incorrect view type casting.

### DESCRIPTION
The app incorrectly casts an EditText to TextInputLayout (or vice versa), causing a ClassCastException during course creation.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Launch FlashCards app
3. Login using any email address
4. Navigate to add new course option
5. Enter course name in the text field
6. Click submit/save button
7. App crashes with ClassCastException

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
The new course should be created and saved successfully after entering the course name.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
App crashes with ClassCastException because code tries to cast EditText to TextInputLayout (or vice versa), which are incompatible types.

### ENVIRONMENT
FlashCards version: commit 1ce0e98
Android version: Various
Device: Various

### NOTE
TextInputLayout is a wrapper/container for EditText, not a subclass or superclass, so direct casting is impossible.
2. User clicks submit/save
3. The app reads the entered text correctly
4. The new course is created and saved
5. User is navigated to the course view or course list
6. No crash occurs

Actual Behavior:
The app crashes with a ClassCastException when attempting to submit the new course. The user cannot create any courses, making the app unusable for its primary purpose on fresh installs.

Crash Details:
- Exception Type: java.lang.ClassCastException
- Error Message: Cannot cast android.widget.EditText to android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout (or vice versa)
- Location: Course creation code when attempting to retrieve text input
- Affected Version: Commit 1ce0e98
- Device: Nexus 6P
- Android Version: 8.0.0 (Oreo)
- Frequency: 100% on fresh installs when creating first course

Stack Trace:
[Not provided in issue, but typical ClassCastException stack trace would show:]
```
java.lang.ClassCastException: android.widget.EditText cannot be cast to android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout

```

Technical Analysis:
This is a common mistake when working with Material Design's TextInputLayout. Developers sometimes forget that:

1. **TextInputLayout is a ViewGroup** that contains an EditText child
2. **EditText is the actual input field** where users type
3. The XML structure is typically:
```xml
<com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputLayout
    android:id="@+id/course_input_layout"
    ...>
    
    <com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputEditText
        android:id="@+id/course_edit_text"
        ... />
        
</com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputLayout>
```

Common causes of this bug:
1. Confusion about which ID refers to which view type
2. Copy-paste errors from code examples
3. Refactoring from plain EditText to TextInputLayout without updating all references
4. Misunderstanding the Material Design component hierarchy

The fix requires:
1. Identify which view ID corresponds to which type (EditText vs TextInputLayout)
2. Update all findViewById() calls to cast to the correct type
3. If getting text from EditText wrapped in TextInputLayout, use:
   - `inputLayout.getEditText().getText().toString()`
   - Or find the EditText child directly by its own ID

Impact:
- Severity: Critical - Core functionality completely broken
- Frequency: 100% on fresh installs when creating first course
- Affected Component: Course creation, user onboarding
- User Impact: New users cannot create any courses, rendering the app completely useless
- First-run Experience: Terrible - app crashes immediately when trying to use main feature

Fresh Install Context:
The bug specifically affects fresh installs, suggesting:
- It may not occur when courses already exist (different code path?)
- First-time users are most affected
- The crash occurs during initial data setup
- This is a critical onboarding failure

Resolution:
Fixed by stephanieMiranda on September 15, 2017 (22 days after initial report).
The fix corrected the bad cast from EditText to TextInputLayout.
Issue closed as completed after verification.

Developer Note:
As stated by the resolver: "The issue was a bad cast from EditText to TextInputLayout. This issue is now resolved."
