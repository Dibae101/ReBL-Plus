Title: Crash on New Course creation

App: FlashCards (ASU CodeDevils)
Package Name: (Not specified, likely edu.asu.codedevils.flashcards or similar)
Issue: https://github.com/ASU-CodeDevils/FlashCards/issues/13

Description:
The FlashCards app crashes when a user attempts to create a new course on a fresh installation. The crash occurs due to an incorrect type cast from EditText to TextInputLayout in the code. This is a ClassCastException where the developer mistakenly tried to cast an EditText widget to a TextInputLayout, which are incompatible types in Android's view hierarchy. TextInputLayout is a wrapper container for EditText, not a subclass or superclass, making this cast invalid.

Root Cause:
The bug is caused by an incorrect view casting in the course creation code. The developer attempted to cast a view reference from EditText to TextInputLayout (or vice versa), which causes a ClassCastException at runtime. This likely happened when finding views by ID:

Problematic code pattern:
```java
// Incorrect casting - causes ClassCastException:
TextInputLayout courseInput = (TextInputLayout) findViewById(R.id.course_edit_text);
// OR
EditText courseInput = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.course_text_input_layout);
```

The correct pattern should be:
```java
// Correct approach 1: Get EditText directly
EditText courseEditText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.course_edit_text);
String courseText = courseEditText.getText().toString();

// Correct approach 2: Get EditText from TextInputLayout
TextInputLayout courseInputLayout = (TextInputLayout) findViewById(R.id.course_input_layout);
EditText courseEditText = courseInputLayout.getEditText();
String courseText = courseEditText.getText().toString();
```

Understanding the Android View Hierarchy:
- TextInputLayout is a container/wrapper view from Material Design Components
- EditText is the actual text input field
- TextInputLayout wraps EditText to provide features like floating labels, error messages, etc.
- They are NOT in the same class hierarchy, so casting between them is impossible

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Perform a fresh install of FlashCards app (commit 1ce0e98) on a device
2. Launch the app for the first time
3. Login using any random email address
4. Navigate to the option to add a new course
5. Enter text in the course name field
6. Click submit/save button
7. Observe the app crashes immediately with ClassCastException

Expected Behavior:
When the user creates a new course:
1. User enters the course name in the text field
2. User clicks submit/save
3. The app reads the entered text correctly
4. The new course is created and saved
5. User is navigated to the course view or course list
6. No crash occurs

Actual Behavior:
The app crashes with a ClassCastException when attempting to submit the new course. The user cannot create any courses, making the app unusable for its primary purpose on fresh installs.

Crash Details:
- Exception Type: java.lang.ClassCastException
- Error Message: Cannot cast android.widget.EditText to android.support.design.widget.TextInputLayout (or vice versa)
- Location: Course creation code when attempting to retrieve text input
- Affected Version: Commit 1ce0e98
- Device: Nexus 6P
- Android Version: 8.0.0 (Oreo)
- Frequency: 100% on fresh installs when creating first course

Stack Trace:
[Not provided in issue, but typical ClassCastException stack trace would show:]
```

    at android.view.View.performClick(View.java:XXXX)

Technical Analysis:
This is a common mistake when working with Material Design's TextInputLayout. Developers sometimes forget that:

1. **TextInputLayout is a ViewGroup** that contains an EditText child
2. **EditText is the actual input field** where users type
3. The XML structure is typically:
```xml
<com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputLayout
    android:id="@+id/course_input_layout"
    ...>
    
    <com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputEditText
        android:id="@+id/course_edit_text"
        ... />
        
</com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputLayout>
```

Common causes of this bug:
1. Confusion about which ID refers to which view type
2. Copy-paste errors from code examples
3. Refactoring from plain EditText to TextInputLayout without updating all references
4. Misunderstanding the Material Design component hierarchy

The fix requires:
1. Identify which view ID corresponds to which type (EditText vs TextInputLayout)
2. Update all findViewById() calls to cast to the correct type
3. If getting text from EditText wrapped in TextInputLayout, use:
   - `inputLayout.getEditText().getText().toString()`
   - Or find the EditText child directly by its own ID

Impact:
- Severity: Critical - Core functionality completely broken
- Frequency: 100% on fresh installs when creating first course
- Affected Component: Course creation, user onboarding
- User Impact: New users cannot create any courses, rendering the app completely useless
- First-run Experience: Terrible - app crashes immediately when trying to use main feature

Fresh Install Context:
The bug specifically affects fresh installs, suggesting:
- It may not occur when courses already exist (different code path?)
- First-time users are most affected
- The crash occurs during initial data setup
- This is a critical onboarding failure

Resolution:
Fixed by stephanieMiranda on September 15, 2017 (22 days after initial report).
The fix corrected the bad cast from EditText to TextInputLayout.
Issue closed as completed after verification.

Developer Note:
As stated by the resolver: "The issue was a bad cast from EditText to TextInputLayout. This issue is now resolved."
