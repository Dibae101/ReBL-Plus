### **Bug Report: Timebox time limit shows "0 cards studied" toast instead of summary dialog**

**Issue Reference:** [https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/6853](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/6853)

**Description:**
When a user sets a "Timebox time limit" (e.g., 1 minute), answering a card after the limit triggers a toast notification instead of the expected summary dialog. Specifically, after the first minute, it correctly shows "1 card studied in 1 minute". However, if the user waits another minute on the next card and answers it, the app displays a toast saying **"0 cards studied in 1 minute"** and continues the session, failing to interrupt the user or show the summary screen.

**Environment:**

* **App:** AnkiDroid
* **Evidence:** Video `6853.mp4`

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open AnkiDroid app
2. Click on hamburger icon and go to **Settings** > **Reviewing**.
3. Tap **Timebox time limit**.
4. Set the limit to **1 minute** and tap **OK**.
5. Open a deck and start reviewing.
6. Wait for 1 minute to pass, then tap an answer button (e.g., **Good**).
7. Observe the toast "1 card studied in 1 minute".
8. Wait for **another 1 minute** on the next card.
9. Tap an answer button (e.g., **Good**).

**Expected Result:**
The app toast message should display 1 cards studied in 1 minute while reviewing second card.
**Actual Result:**
The app displays a toast message saying **"0 cards studied in 1 minute"** and immediately loads the next card, failing to interrupt the session.
