Bug Report Title: App crashes when adding medicine to med kit via User's Medicines section

Issue Description:
When navigating to the User's Medicines section and attempting to add a medicine (by searching for a name and tapping 'add to med kit'), the app crashes. This is confirmed by multiple users and is reproducible in version 2.5.7 from F-Droid. The crash is due to a fragment management issue when opening the add/remove medicine stock dialog.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Calendula app.
2. Navigate to the User's Medicines section.
3. Tap to add a new medicine.
4. Search for a medicine by name.
5. Tap 'add to med kit'.
6. (Alternatively, edit a medicine and tap the '+' or '-' button to adjust stock.)

Expected Behavior:
- The add/remove dialog should be displayed, allowing the user to add or remove medicine stock.

Actual Behavior:
- The app crashes and returns to the medicine screen. Exception observed:
  java.lang.IllegalStateException: Fragment ... declared target fragment ... that does not belong to this FragmentManager!
  at android.support.v4.app.p.a(Unknown Source:303)
  ...

Environment:
- App version: 2.5.7 (F-Droid)
- Device: Samsung A5 2017 (confirmed by user)
- OS: Android 8.0.0
- Reproducible: Always

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- The crash is caused by fragments being launched from another fragment but not using the correct FragmentManager. The last version of support-v4 prevents fragments from setting targets in different FragmentManagers.

Fix/Resolution:
- Fixed by using SupportFragmentManager for fragments launched from another fragment. See commit ca4d7b6c9d24bfc99adefab2060edadf06d4e7c7.

Additional User Confirmation:
