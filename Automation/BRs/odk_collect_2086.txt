App: ODK Collect

Bug Report Title: Import QR code with invalid data types crashes app

Description:
ODK Collect crashes and becomes completely unusable when importing settings from a malformed QR code. The app doesn't validate data types in imported settings, so a QR code with Boolean value in password field (instead of String) causes ClassCastException on every app launch.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch ODK Collect app
2. Navigate to Admin settings > Import/Export settings
3. Click "SCAN CODE FROM OTHER DEVICE" button
4. Scan a malformed QR code with Boolean password field
5. App crashes with "ODK Collect has stopped"
6. Reopen app
7. App crashes on every launch - permanently broken

Expected Behavior:
App should validate imported settings data types, show "Invalid QR code" error if incorrect, and keep functioning normally.

Actual Behavior:
App accepts invalid QR code, saves incorrect types to SharedPreferences, then crashes on every launch at Collect.onCreate(). Only recovery is clearing app data or reinstall.

Crash: ClassCastException - java.lang.Boolean cannot be cast to java.lang.String at SharedPreferencesImpl.getString()

Environment:
- Device: Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016)
- Android Version: 6.0.1
- App Version: ODK Collect v1.14.0-beta.1

Stack Trace:
```

```

Technical Analysis:
The issue occurs when custom QR codes are generated programmatically (e.g., using PHP) for automated user registration. The QR code format requires:
1. JSON settings data
2. Compression (gzip)
3. Base64 encoding

If the JSON contains incorrect types (Boolean instead of String for password), the import succeeds but the app becomes permanently broken.

The fix requires two changes:
1. **Fail early**: Validate setting types when QR code is scanned, before saving to SharedPreferences
2. **Fail gracefully**: If corrupt settings already exist, show a toast message and load default values instead of crashing

Use Case Context:
Users were generating custom QR codes programmatically to register users to ODK Aggregate and provide them with pre-configured settings QR codes. This is a valid use case documented at: https://docs.opendatakit.org/collect-import-export/#making-your-own-qr-code/

Impact:
- Severity: Critical - App becomes completely unusable, crashes on every launch
- Frequency: 100% when scanning a malformed QR code with type mismatches
- Recovery: Requires clearing app data or reinstalling (data loss)
- Affected Component: Settings import/export, QR code scanning
- User Impact: Users lose all data and settings; cannot use the app until manual intervention
- Deployment Impact: Broken QR codes distributed to multiple users can break ODK Collect for entire teams

Resolution:
Fixed in multiple commits by seadowg in October-November 2018:
- Commit 0be35a7: "Show toast to user when invalid QR code scanned Fixes #2086"
- Commit 84fe978: "Show user a toast when they try to view server settings with corrupt preferences"
- Commit 5eef847: "Show toast to user when invalid QR code scanned Fixes #2086"
- PR #2703: "Don't let user save invalid preferences"

The fix implements type validation before importing settings and graceful error handling for already-corrupted settings.
