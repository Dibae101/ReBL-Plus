App Name: Birthdroid

Bug Report Title:
App crashes when setting Foresight Period with value > 10 digits

Bug Report Issue:
Birthdroid crashes when user enters a foresight period value with 11 or more digits in the settings.

### DESCRIPTION
The app doesn't validate input length for the Foresight Period setting, causing integer overflow crash when values exceed 10 digits.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open Birthdroid app
2. Tap menu and go to Settings
3. Find "Foresight Period" setting
4. Tap on it to edit
5. Enter a value with 11 or more digits (e.g., "11111111111")
6. Save or confirm the setting
7. App crashes

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
The app should either limit input to maximum 10 digits or show an error message for invalid values.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
App crashes when trying to save a foresight period value with more than 10 digits due to integer overflow.

### ENVIRONMENT
Birthdroid version: Debug build
Android version: Various
Device: Various

Crash Details:
- Trigger: Entering an 11+ digit number in the "Foresight Period" setting
- Likely cause: Integer overflow or NumberFormatException when parsing the input value
- The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2,147,483,647 (10 digits)
- Values exceeding this will cause overflow or parsing errors

Test Values That Cause Crash:
- "11111111111" (11 digits)
- "99999999999" (11 digits)
- Any number with more than 10 digits

Related Issue:
This is a duplicate of issue #12, indicating input validation problems in the settings.

Notes:
The foresight period should have a reasonable maximum limit (e.g., 365 days for one year, or 3650 for 10 years). Values in the billions of days are not practical for a birthday reminder application.
