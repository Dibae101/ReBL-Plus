Title: Setting "Foresight Period" with any integer greater than 10 digits crashes application

App: Birthdroid
Package: de.j4velin.birthdayreminder
Issue: https://github.com/rigid/Birthdroid/issues/13

Description:
The application crashes when a user enters a foresight period value with more than 10 digits in the settings. This is likely due to an integer overflow or improper input validation.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Birthdroid app
2. Go to Settings
3. Find "Foresight Period" setting
4. Enter a value with 11 or more digits (e.g., "11111111111")
5. Save or confirm the setting

Expected Behavior:
The app should either:
- Limit the input to a reasonable maximum value (e.g., 10 digits)
- Display an error message indicating the value is too large
- Gracefully handle the large number without crashing

Actual Behavior:
The application crashes when trying to save a foresight period value with more than 10 digits.

Crash Details:
- Trigger: Entering an 11+ digit number in the "Foresight Period" setting
- Likely cause: Integer overflow or NumberFormatException when parsing the input value
- The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2,147,483,647 (10 digits)
- Values exceeding this will cause overflow or parsing errors

Test Values That Cause Crash:
- "11111111111" (11 digits)
- "99999999999" (11 digits)
- Any number with more than 10 digits

Related Issue:
This is a duplicate of issue #12, indicating input validation problems in the settings.

Notes:
The foresight period should have a reasonable maximum limit (e.g., 365 days for one year, or 3650 for 10 years). Values in the billions of days are not practical for a birthday reminder application.
