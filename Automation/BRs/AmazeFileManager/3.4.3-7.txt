Bug Report Title: Unhiding hidden files does not show the file (requires a refresh)

Issue ID: 1712

Issue Description:
When a user removes a file from the hidden files list by unhiding it, the file does not immediately appear in the file browser. The file only becomes visible when the user manually triggers a refresh of the current file view. This creates a poor user experience as users expect immediate feedback when unhiding files.

Environment:
- App Version: 3.4.x (pre-3.5)
- Device: Not specified
- OS: Android (version not specified)
- Rooted: No
- Reproducible: Yes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a test folder with some files for testing.
2. Select a file in the file browser.
3. Tap "Hide" to hide the selected file.
4. Tap "Hidden Files" from the top right context menu to open the hidden files dialog.
5. Tap "x" on the file to remove it from the hidden files list (unhide it).
6. Tap "Cancel" to dismiss the hidden files dialog.
7. Observe that the unhidden file does not appear in the file browser.
8. Try manually refreshing the file view to see the file appear.

Expected Behavior:
The file removed from the hidden files list should be immediately visible in the file browser after dismissing the hidden files dialog. The file list should automatically refresh to reflect the change.

Observed Behavior:
The file is not immediately visible after unhiding it. The file only becomes visible when the user manually triggers a refresh of the current file view, requiring an extra user action.

Root Cause (if known):
The hidden files dialog did not have an update listener attached to refresh the file list when changes were made to the hidden files. The dialog dismissal did not trigger a file list update.
