App Name: Amaze File Manager

Bug Report Title: After giving storage permission normally, rotating the screen and clicking the back button will cause you to be unable to use amazefilemanager normally

Issue ID: 1919

Issue Description:
After granting storage permission to Amaze File Manager during first launch, if the user rotates the screen and then clicks the back button, the app fails to load files properly. The file list appears empty as if storage access was never granted. This issue persists even after restarting the app, requiring a complete reinstallation to resolve.

Environment:
- App Version: v3.4.3
- Device: Galaxy A6s
- OS: Android 8.1.0
- Rooted: No
- Reproducible: Yes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install and open Amaze File Manager.
2. When prompted for storage permission, click on "ALWAYS ALLOW" to grant storage permission.
3. Rotate the screen.
4. Click the back button of the phone.
5. Observe that the displayed file list is empty as if storage permission was not granted.

Expected Behavior:
After granting storage permission, the user should be able to see their files and use Amaze File Manager normally, regardless of screen rotation or navigation actions.

Observed Behavior:
After granting storage permission, rotating the screen and clicking back causes the file list to appear empty. The app permanently loses access to files until it is reinstalled.

Root Cause (if known):
The issue is related to how the app handles storage permissions during configuration changes (screen rotation). The tabs fail to load properly after storage permissions are granted if a screen rotation occurs. The fix ensures tabs load correctly after storage permissions are granted.

Additional Notes:
If the user manually grants storage permission through system settings before opening Amaze File Manager, this error does not occur, suggesting the issue is specific to the runtime permission flow.
