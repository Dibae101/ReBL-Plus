App Name: Amaze File Manager

Bug Report Title: Spaces turn to "%20" when renaming files

Issue ID: 2113

Issue Description:
When renaming a file in Amaze File Manager and adding spaces to the new name, the spaces are replaced with "%20" in the resulting filename. This is unexpected, as users expect spaces to remain as spaces in file names, not be URL-encoded.

Environment:
- App Version: (not specified, but issue reported on recent versions)
- Device: (not specified)
- OS: (not specified)
- Reproducible: Yes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Amaze File Manager.
2. Select any file that does not have spaces in its name.
3. Rename the file, adding spaces to the new name (e.g., "My File.txt").
4. Observe the resulting filename.

Expected Behavior:
The file should be renamed with spaces in the name (e.g., "My File.txt").

Observed Behavior:
The spaces in the new filename are replaced with "%20" (e.g., "My%20File.txt").

Root Cause (if known):
The rename functionality was incorrectly encoding spaces as "%20" instead of leaving them as spaces. The fix ensures spaces are preserved in file names.
