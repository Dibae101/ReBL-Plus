App Name: Amaze File Manager

Bug Report Title: Screen rotation when AmazeFileManager requests permission will cause AmazeFileManager black screen

Issue ID: 1885

Issue Description:
When Amaze File Manager is opened for the first time and displays the permission request dialog, rotating the screen causes the app to get stuck and then display a black screen. This prevents the user from granting the necessary storage permissions and using the app.

Environment:
- App Version: v3.4.3
- Device: HUAWEI nova 5 pro (also reproducible on Fairphone 3 with LineageOS 16.0 GSI)
- OS: EMUI 9.1.1
- Rooted: No
- Reproducible: Yes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Amaze File Manager and open the app for the first time.
2. The permission request box appears.
3. Rotate the screen while the permission dialog is displayed.
4. Observe a black screen appears and the app becomes unresponsive.

Expected Behavior:
The app should handle screen rotation gracefully without showing a black screen, and the user should still be able to accept or deny the permission request.

Observed Behavior:
After rotating the screen during the permission request, the app displays a black screen and becomes stuck, preventing normal operation.

Root Cause (if known):
The app reloads on orientation changes, which causes issues when a permission dialog is displayed. The fix forces the screen to lock orientation when the permission dialog appears on first launch as a workaround.
