App Name: Amaze File Manager

Bug Report Title:
Obsolete FTP status after stop it in notification

Bug Report Issue:
Amaze File Manager displays an incorrect FTP server status when the server is stopped via notification. The app shows "Running" status even after the FTP server has been stopped from the notification.

### DESCRIPTION
When the FTP server is started and then stopped using the notification action while Amaze is in the background, the app fails to update the FTP server status display. Upon returning to the app, it incorrectly shows the FTP server as "Running" when it is actually stopped.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open Amaze File Manager app
2. Navigate to FTP settings
3. Start the FTP server (tap to enable it)
4. Switch to another app or press the Home button (send Amaze to background)
5. Open the notification panel
6. Tap the "Stop" button in the FTP server notification
7. Switch back to Amaze File Manager app
8. Check the FTP server status in settings

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
When returning to Amaze app after stopping the FTP server from the notification, the FTP status should correctly display "Not Running" or "Stopped".

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
The FTP status continues to show "Running" even though the server has been stopped via the notification. The UI does not reflect the actual state of the FTP service.

### ENVIRONMENT
Amaze File Manager version: 3.6.0 (recent commit build)
Android version: Lineage OS 16.0 (Android 9)
Device: Redmi Note Pro 7
Rooted: No

### ROOT CAUSE
The app does not update the FTP server status display when resuming from the background. The UI state is not synchronized with the actual FTP service state when the service is stopped from outside the main app interface.

### FIX
- Make FtpService.server a static field to work with FtpService.isRunning() static method
- Update FTP server status display in onResume() lifecycle method
- This allows the status to update even if Amaze and the FTP service are running in the background
