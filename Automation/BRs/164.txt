App Name: K-9 Mail / Thunderbird for Android

Bug Report Title:
App closes on pressing back button in manual setup

Bug Report Issue:
When setting up a new email account and navigating to the manual setup screen, pressing the back button causes the entire app to close instead of returning to the previous setup screen. This prevents users from correcting mistakes or changing setup options.

### DESCRIPTION
During the new account setup process, when users choose manual setup instead of automatic configuration, pressing the Android back button unexpectedly closes the entire application. Instead of navigating back to the previous screen in the setup flow, the app exits completely, forcing users to restart the setup process from the beginning.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open K-9 Mail / Thunderbird app
2. Begin creating a new email account
3. On the account setup screen, tap "Manual setup"
4. Once the manual setup screen loads, press the device back button
5. Observe the app behavior

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
Pressing the back button during manual setup should:
- Return the user to the previous screen in the account setup flow
- Maintain the setup progress and any information already entered
- Allow users to navigate back through the setup wizard
- Follow standard Android back navigation behavior

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
When the back button is pressed during manual setup:
- The entire app closes/exits
- All setup progress is lost
- The user must restart the setup process from scratch
- No warning or confirmation is shown before closing
- The app returns to the home screen or previous app

### ENVIRONMENT
Android version: API 24 (Android 7.0)
K-9 Mail version: Not specified (issue reported March 2019)

### VISUAL DEMONSTRATION
A GIF was provided in the original issue showing the unexpected app closure when pressing back during manual setup.

### ROOT CAUSE
The manual setup activity is not properly handling the back button navigation. The activity likely has incorrect navigation settings or missing parent activity configuration, causing the back button to exit the app entirely rather than navigating to the previous activity in the setup flow.

### IMPACT
- Poor user experience during account setup
- Users cannot easily correct mistakes in the setup process
- Setup must be completely restarted if user accidentally presses back
- Violates Android navigation best practices and user expectations

### FIX
Fix the back navigation in the setup flow to properly return to the previous screen. This was addressed in PR #5085 which fixed the setup back navigation behavior.

### FIXED IN
PR #5085 - "Fix setup back navigation" (merged January 6, 2021)
