Issue Summary: Unbury function does not work properly - buried cards cannot be unburied using the deck picker's long-press menu, and buried cards are not searchable in card browser.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the AnkiDroid app
2. Tap on any deck to start reviewing cards
3. During review, tap on the three dots menu in the top right corner
4. Select "Bury card" from the menu to bury the current card
5. Continue to the next card and repeat steps 3-4 to bury 2 or 3 more cards
6. Exit the deck and go back to the main deck list screen
7. Tap on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner
8. Select "Card Browser" from the navigation drawer
9. In the card browser, tap on the search/magnifier icon at the top
10. Enter "is:buried" in the search box and tap search
11. Observe the search results

Expected Result: The card browser should display all the cards that were manually buried in steps 3-5. The search query "is:buried" should return a list of all buried cards from the deck.

Actual Result: The card browser shows no results for the "is:buried" search query. None of the buried cards appear in the search results, even though they were successfully buried earlier. Additionally, attempting to unbury cards by long-pressing on a deck in the deck list and selecting "Unbury" does not work - it either fails to unbury any cards or unburys the wrong number of cards, especially after finishing all daily reviews.

Additional Notes: The unbury functionality works inconsistently - it may work before finishing the day's tasks but typically fails after completing all reviews. The issue is related to deck selection: the unbury operation was attempting to unbury cards from the currently selected deck, but the deck picker's long-press menu does not change the deck selection. As a workaround until fixed, users must select the deck they want to unbury before pressing "Unbury". This issue was introduced in version 2.10 and was fixed in PR #6222 by allowing unbury to work on non-selected decks.
