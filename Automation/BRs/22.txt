Bug Report Title: New "edit times" screen harder to use than old screen

Issue Description:
The new edit times screen, which uses side-by-side vertically scrolling lists for hours and minutes, is significantly less efficient and more cumbersome to use than the previous circular clock face selector. Selecting a specific time value now requires scrolling through long lists, making the process time-consuming and less user-friendly.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the menu.
2. Click "add activity".
3. Long-press a task with time values.
4. Scroll the popup menu (if necessary) and select "show times".
5. Tap a time range to edit.
6. The new time picker with vertical lists for hours and minutes appears.
7. To select a time (e.g., change from 09:45 to 09:15), you must scroll the minutes list across many entries (bug: the new UI is slow and inefficient for time selection).

Expected Behavior:
- The time picker should allow quick and easy selection of hours and minutes, similar to the old circular clock face UI, minimizing the amount of scrolling required.

Actual Behavior:
- The new UI requires scrolling through long lists of hours (24 entries) and minutes (60 entries), making time selection slow and tedious.

Environment:
- App version: (not specified, but issue observed after update to new UI)
- Device: Moto E4
- OS: Android 7.1.1
- Reproducible: Always

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- The default date and time pickers changed in later API levels, resulting in the new, less efficient UI. The developer reverted to the old layout in response to user feedback.

Fix/Resolution:
- The issue was fixed by explicitly specifying the use of the old calendar/clock date/time picker widgets. See commit 02ed5cdf178588f6caf0f7eaa37620644280ae01.
