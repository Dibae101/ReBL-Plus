App Name: andOTP

Bug Report Title:
Switching language is not working

Bug Report Issue:
When attempting to switch the app language to Arabic (or other languages), andOTP fails to display the selected language and instead falls back to English. The language switching functionality does not work properly, particularly for Arabic language.

### DESCRIPTION
The andOTP app does not properly switch to certain languages when selected in the app's language settings. Specifically, when trying to switch to Arabic, the app continues to display the interface in English rather than the selected language. This issue persists whether the language is changed within the app settings or at the Android system level.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open andOTP app
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Scroll down and Select Language settings
4. Choose Arabic (or French) from the language options
5. Observe that the UI remains in English
6. Alternative: Change the Android system language to Arabic
7. Open andOTP app
8. Observe that the app still displays in English instead of Arabic

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
When the user selects a language from the app's settings (e.g., Arabic, French), the entire user interface should immediately switch to display text in the selected language. If the Android system language is set to a supported language, the app should respect and display that language as well.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
The app falls back to English regardless of the language selected. Even when both the app language setting and the Android system language are set to Arabic, the app continues to display the interface in English. The language switching functionality does not work properly.

### ENVIRONMENT
andOTP version: 0.7.1.1
Android version: 6.0
App source: GitHub

### ROOT CAUSE
The issue is related to how language resources are organized in the app. The app is using regionalized language folders (e.g., `values-rLangRegion`) instead of the standard language-only folders (e.g., `values-ar`, `values-fr`). Android's resource system may not be properly matching the requested language with the regionalized folder structure, causing it to fall back to the default English resources.

### SIMILAR ISSUES
This is a known issue pattern documented in other projects, such as TwidereProject/Twidere-Android#1319.

### FIX
Remove language region specificity from resource folders. Use standard language folders (`values-ar`, `values-fr`, etc.) instead of regionalized versions (`values-ar-rXX`). This can be configured in Crowdin to disable region-specific translations. The fix involves restructuring the language resource folders to follow Android's standard language matching conventions.
