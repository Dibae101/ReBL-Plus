App Name: A Time Tracker

Bug Report Title:
App crashes when toggling activities with sound enabled

Bug Report Issue:
A Time Tracker crashes when starting or stopping activities after returning from background, specifically when sound is enabled in settings.

### DESCRIPTION
When sound is enabled and the app is sent to background then brought back to foreground, tapping any activity causes a crash due to MediaPlayer being null.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Launch A Time Tracker app
2. Tap menu and go to Settings
3. Enable sound in Settings
4. Press home button to send app to background
5. Reopen A Time Tracker app
6. Tap on any activity to start or stop it
7. App crashes with NullPointerException

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### ENVIRONMENT

Device: Samsung Galaxy S5
Android version: 9 (LineageOS)

### WORKAROUND
Disable sound in Settings to avoid the crash.
