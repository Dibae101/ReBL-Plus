App Name: A Time Tracker

Bug Report Title:
App crashes when attempting to restore backup

Bug Report Issue:
A Time Tracker crashes immediately when user selects the "Restore" option from the menu, typically when no backup file exists.

### DESCRIPTION
The app doesn't check if a backup file exists before attempting to restore, causing a crash with FileNotFoundException.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Launch A Time Tracker app
2. Tap the menu button (three dots or overflow menu)
3. Select "Restore" option
4. App crashes immediately with "Unfortunately, A Time Tracker has stopped"

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
If no backup file exists, the app should display an error message like "Backup file not found. Please create a backup first."

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
App crashes with FileNotFoundException when trying to read a non-existent backup file.

### ENVIRONMENT
A Time Tracker version: 0.20-works_debug
Android version: Various
Device: Various

### NOTE
Crash occurs when:
- No backup file has been created yet
- Backup file was deleted or moved
- SD card is not accessible
- The app should remain stable and not crash
- The user should be able to continue using the app normally after dismissing the error

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
The app crashes immediately when the restore menu option is selected. The crash happens:
- Before any file selection dialog appears
- Directly after tapping the Restore menu item
- With the standard Android crash dialog: "Unfortunately, A Time Tracker has stopped"
- The app is force closed and user returns to home screen or previous app

The crash is consistent and reproducible every time the restore is attempted when the backup file is missing or inaccessible.

### DEVICE INFORMATION
- App: A Time Tracker
- Affected Version: 0.20 and earlier (fixed in 0.22)
- Android Version: Any
- Device Type: Any device (especially those without SD card)
- Storage: Issue occurs when backup file doesn't exist or SD card missing

### TECHNICAL DETAILS
Crash occurs during backup restoration attempt when:
- FileNotFoundException is thrown for missing backup file
- IOException occurs when file cannot be read
- Storage is not accessible or mounted
- No exception handling exists around file operations

The fix (in commit c9be242 and 59bbf73) added:
1. Check for backup file existence before restoration
2. Exception handling for file operations
3. Error message display instead of crash

### REPRODUCTION SCENARIOS
Scenario 1 - First time user (no backup created):
1. Launch A Time Tracker app
2. Don't create any backup
3. Try to restore → CRASH

Scenario 2 - Device without SD card:
1. Use device without external SD card
2. Try to restore → CRASH

Scenario 3 - Deleted backup:
1. Create a backup
2. Manually delete backup file from SD card
3. Try to restore → CRASH

### REPRODUCTION SUCCESS CRITERIA
The bug is successfully reproduced when:
1. User navigates to Menu → Restore
2. App crashes immediately with "Unfortunately, A Time Tracker has stopped"
3. No error message or dialog appears before crash
4. App is force closed
5. LogCat shows FileNotFoundException or IOException without proper handling

### TESTING NOTES
- Easiest reproduction: Fresh install without creating backup first
- The crash is immediate and consistent
- No user interaction needed after selecting Restore menu
- Fixed in version 0.22 with proper error handling
- The issue was confirmed by both the reporter and the developer
- Testing should be done on version 0.20 or earlier to reproduce the bug
