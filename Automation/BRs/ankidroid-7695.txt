### **Bug Report: "Rename note type" title displayed incorrectly when renaming a field**

**Description:**
When attempting to rename a specific field (e.g., "Front") within the "Edit fields" menu, the dialog box that appears is incorrectly titled "**Rename note type**". The expected title for this dialog should be "**Rename field**" to accurately reflect the action being performed.

2. Select **Manage note types**.
3. Tap on a note type (e.g., "Basic") to open the **Edit fields** screen.
4. Tap on a field name (e.g., "Front") to open the field options menu.
5. Select **Rename field**.
6. Observe the title of the dialog box that appears.

**Actual Result:**
The dialog box is titled "**Rename note type**", even though the user is renaming a specific field.

**Expected Result:**
The dialog box should be titled "**Rename field**".

**Environment:**

* **App:** AnkiDroid
* **Feature:** Manage Note Types / Edit Fields
