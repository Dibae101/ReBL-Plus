App Name: Memento Calendar

Bug Report Title:
App crashes when setting invalid date like February 30th

Bug Report Issue:
Memento Calendar crashes when user selects an invalid date (like Feb 30, Feb 31, April 31) using the birthday date picker.

### DESCRIPTION
The date picker doesn't dynamically adjust maximum day value based on selected month, allowing invalid dates to be selected.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Method 1:
1. Launch Memento Calendar app v11.2
2. Click '+' to create new contact
3. Click birthday field
4. Select February as month
5. Scroll day picker to "30"
6. Click "Set" to confirm
7. App crashes immediately

Method 2:
1. Create new contact, click birthday field
2. Disable 'include year'
3. Slide month to March
4. Slide day selector to 31
5. Slide month back to February (don't click Set yet)
6. Click "Set"
7. App crashes

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
Day picker maximum should auto-adjust based on month:
- February: 28 days (29 in leap years)
- April, June, Sept, Nov: 30 days
- Other months: 31 days
If day is 31 and user changes to February, day should reset to 28.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
App crashes when invalid date is confirmed (Feb 30, April 31, etc.).

### ENVIRONMENT
Memento version: v11.2
Android version: Various
Device: Samsung J7 Prime

### NOTE
2018 is not a leap year, February should only show 28 days.

Crash Details:
- Exception Type: Likely IllegalArgumentException or DateTimeException
- Symptom: Immediate crash when confirming invalid date
- Affected Version: v11.2
- Device: Samsung J7 Prime
- Android Version: Android 7.0 Nougat
- Frequency: 100% when setting invalid dates like Feb 30

Screenshot:
Shows date picker displaying "30 Feb 2018" which is an invalid date (February only has 28 days in 2018).

Technical Analysis:
The issue is in the EventDatePicker implementation. The picker needs to:

1. **Calculate maximum days dynamically using JodaTime**:
```java
// Correct approach:
int maxDaysInMonth = getMaxDaysForMonthYear(month, year);
dayPicker.setMaxValue(maxDaysInMonth);

private int getMaxDaysForMonthYear(int month, int year) {
    if (year > 0) {
        // Year is specified - use actual leap year logic
        return new LocalDate(year, month, 1).dayOfMonth().getMaximumValue();
    } else {
        // Year not specified - handle February specially
        if (month == 2) {
            return 29; // Allow 29 for February when year unknown
        }
        return new LocalDate(2000, month, 1).dayOfMonth().getMaximumValue();
    }
}
```

2. **Add listener for month/year changes**:
```java
monthPicker.setOnValueChangedListener(new OnValueChangeListener() {
    @Override
    public void onValueChange(NumberPicker picker, int oldVal, int newVal) {
        updateMaxDayForMonth(newVal, currentYear);
        // If current day exceeds new max, adjust it
        if (dayPicker.getValue() > maxDaysInMonth) {
            dayPicker.setValue(maxDaysInMonth);
        }
    }
});
```

3. **Handle edge case for February without year**:
When "include year" is disabled, the app allows 29 days for February to accommodate leap years, but should still prevent Feb 30 or 31.

Common Date Constraints:
- February: 28 days (29 in leap years)
- April, June, September, November: 30 days
- All other months: 31 days

Leap year calculation:
- Divisible by 4 = leap year
- Except if divisible by 100 = not a leap year
- Except if divisible by 400 = leap year
- 2018 is NOT a leap year (not divisible by 4)

Impact:
- Severity: High - Complete crash when setting birthdays
- Frequency: Occurs whenever invalid date is selected (relatively easy to trigger)
- Affected Component: Contact creation, birthday date picker
- User Impact: Users cannot set birthdays for contacts if they accidentally select invalid dates
- Data Integrity: Invalid dates can't be saved, but crash prevents error message from showing

Use Case Context:
Memento Calendar is a contacts birthday reminder app. The ability to set birthdays is core functionality. This bug directly affects the primary user workflow and makes the app appear buggy and unreliable.

Resolution:
Fixed by madlymad in PR #180: "Use max day in picker depending on month, year"
Closed by alexstyl on April 30, 2018.

The fix implemented:
1. Used JodaTime to calculate accepted day values based on month/year
2. Override Joda logic when year is not present for February to maintain existing functionality (allow up to 29 days)
3. Dynamically update day picker maximum based on month selection

Released in Version 12.1 (mentioned in PR #194).
