Bug Report: AnkiDroid - Saved Whiteboard Has Inverted Background Color

App: AnkiDroid
Version: 2.15alpha10
Android Version: Not specified
Device: Not specified

Issue Summary:
When using the whiteboard feature with the Plain Theme and "black strokes" disabled, the saved whiteboard image has an inverted background color. The saved PNG file shows drawings on a black background instead of the expected white background, making the saved image inconsistent with the whiteboard appearance during use.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open AnkiDroid app
2. Navigate to Settings > Reviewing
3. Disable the "black strokes" checkbox option
4. Go back to main Settings
5. Navigate to Settings > Appearance
6. Select "Plain Theme" as the Day theme
7. Return to deck list and select any deck to start reviewing
8. Open a flashcard for review
9. Tap on the three dots menu (More options) in the top right
10. Select "Enable whiteboard" from the menu
11. Draw/scribble on the whiteboard using the doodle pen (make visible strokes on the canvas)
12. Tap on the three dots menu (More options) again
13. Select "Save whiteboard" from the menu
14. Note the toast message showing the file save location (e.g., /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/AnkiDroid/Whiteboard[timestamp].png)
15. Open the device's file manager application
16. Navigate to Files > Pictures > AnkiDroid folder
17. Locate the saved PNG file (Whiteboard[timestamp].png)
18. Open the PNG file to view its contents and observe the background color

Expected Result:
The saved whiteboard image should display blue strokes (or whatever color was selected) on a white background, matching the visual appearance of the whiteboard during drawing. The background color should be white because the Plain Theme is selected and "black strokes" is disabled.

Actual Result:
The saved whiteboard PNG file displays blue strokes (or selected color) on a black background. The background color is incorrectly inverted, showing black instead of white, despite using the Plain Theme with "black strokes" disabled.

Additional Notes:
- The issue is caused by incorrect logic in Whiteboard.java lines 500-504 where the background color is inverted
- The "black strokes" setting was originally designed as a memory optimization to use low bit colors
- After the introduction of the color picker feature, the "black strokes" setting became obsolete and no longer functions as intended
- The foregroundColor logic incorrectly determines the canvas background based on monochrome and inverted settings
- Fixed in PR #7858 by removing legacy whiteboard settings and simplifying the color logic
- The fix removes the "black strokes" setting entirely and bases foreground color solely on the night mode (inverted) setting
- Related to PR #6451 which introduced additional pen colors
