App Name: AntennaPod

Bug Report Title: Download filter "Cancel" & "Confirm" buttons are invisible in Light/System theme

Issue ID: 3977

Issue Description:
When using the Light or System theme in AntennaPod, the "Cancel" and "Confirm" buttons in the Include/Exclude download filter settings are invisible, making it difficult for users to interact with these options. The buttons are visible when the app is switched to Dark mode.

Environment:
- App Version: 1.8.1 (from F-Droid and Google Play/beta)
- Device: Pixel 2 XL (example)
- OS: Android 10 (March 5)
- Reproducible: Yes (any/new install)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open AntennaPod.
2. Select any podcast.
3. Go to Settings (gear icon).
4. Go to Auto Download Settings > Episode Filter.
5. Observe the Include/Exclude download filter settings.
6. Note that the "Cancel" and "Confirm" buttons are invisible if the theme is set to Light or System.
7. Switch to Dark mode (Settings > User Interface > Select Theme > Dark mode).
8. Observe that the buttons are now visible.

Expected Behavior:
The "Cancel" and "Confirm" buttons should be visible in all themes, including Light and System.

Observed Behavior:
The buttons are invisible in Light or System theme, but visible in Dark mode.

Root Cause (if known):
The button background colors were not set to use default colors, causing them to blend with the background in Light/System themes. Fixed by using default colors for button backgrounds.
