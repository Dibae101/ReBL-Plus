Bug Report: AnkiDroid - Rebuilding Filtered Deck Un-suspends Cards (V2 Scheduler)

App: AnkiDroid
Version: Not specified
Android Version: Not specified
Device: Not specified

Issue Summary:
When using the Experimental V2 Scheduler, if a card is suspended while studying a Filtered Deck, the "Suspended" status is successfully applied initially. However, rebuilding the filtered deck immediately resets the card's status, un-suspending it. The card disappears from the is:suspended search, indicating its state has been reverted.

Prerequisites:
- Experimental V2 Scheduler must be enabled (Settings > Advanced > Experimental V2 scheduler)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open AnkiDroid app
2. Navigate to Settings > Advanced
3. Scroll down and enable "Experimental V2 scheduler" checkbox
4. Tap "OK" on the confirmation dialog
5. Return to the main Decks screen
6. Tap the + (Plus) button in the bottom right corner
7. Tap "Create filtered deck"
8. Name the deck (e.g., "Filtered Deck 1") and tap "CREATE"
9. In the filtered deck options, set "Search" to: deck:default is:due or is:new (or any valid search query)
10. Tap "Limit to" and set it to 100 (or any number)
11. Tap "STUDY" to build the deck and enter review mode
12. When the first card appears (e.g., "CONCLUDE"), tap the three dots menu in the top right corner
13. Select "Suspend card" from the menu
14. Observe that the card disappears from view as expected
15. Return to the main screen and open the navigation drawer/sidebar
16. Select "Card browser"
17. In the Card browser, search for: is:suspended
18. Verify that the suspended card (e.g., "CONCLUDE") appears in the search results
19. Return to the main Decks screen
20. Long-press on "Filtered Deck 1"
21. Select "Rebuild" from the context menu
22. Open the Card browser again via the sidebar
23. Search for: is:suspended
24. Observe the search results

Expected Result:
The card should remain suspended after rebuilding the filtered deck. The is:suspended search should continue to show the suspended card (e.g., "CONCLUDE"). Rebuilding a filtered deck should simply refresh the deck contents based on the filter criteria without modifying the scheduling or suspension state of cards that were previously suspended.

Actual Result:
After rebuilding the filtered deck, the search for is:suspended returns "0 cards shown". The card (e.g., "CONCLUDE") is no longer suspended. Rebuilding the filtered deck caused the card to lose its suspended status, effectively un-suspending it without user action.

Additional Notes:
- This issue is specific to the Experimental V2 Scheduler
- The initial suspension works correctly
- The bug occurs specifically during the rebuild operation of a filtered deck
- This behavior is unexpected as rebuilding should only affect which cards are included in the filtered deck, not their suspension state
