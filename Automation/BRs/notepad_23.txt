Bug Report Title:
App crashes when sending note via long-press menu

Bug Report Issue:
Notepad crashes when user selects "Send note" option after long-pressing on a note in the list.

### DESCRIPTION
The app crashes when trying to share a note through the context menu, likely due to improper intent creation or missing null checks.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE

2. Ensure at least one note is saved
3. Long-press (long tap) on a note in the note list
4. Context menu appears
5. Select "Send note" option
6. App crashes immediately

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
The app should:
- Launch Android share intent chooser
- Allow user to select app to share with (Email, SMS, etc.)
- Successfully share note content
- Return to note list without crashing

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
