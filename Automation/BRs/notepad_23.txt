Title: Long tap on note > send note > crash

App: Notepad (Banderlabs)
Package: com.banderlabs.notepad
Issue: https://code.google.com/archive/p/banderlabs/issues/23

Description:
The application crashes when attempting to send a note using the "send note" option after long-pressing on a note in the list. This is a reproducible crash in the share/send functionality.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Notepad app
2. Ensure you have at least one note saved
3. Long-press (long tap) on a note in the note list
4. A context menu appears
5. Select "Send note" option
6. The app crashes immediately

Expected Behavior:
When selecting "Send note" from the context menu, the app should:
- Launch the Android share intent chooser
- Allow the user to select an app to share the note with (Email, SMS, etc.)
- Successfully share the note content through the selected app
- Return to the note list without crashing

Actual Behavior:
The application crashes immediately when the "Send note" option is selected from the long-press context menu.

Crash Details:
- Trigger: Selecting "Send note" after long-pressing a note
- Likely cause: NullPointerException or improper intent creation when trying to share the note
- The crash suggests issues with:
  - Intent creation for sharing functionality
  - Note content retrieval before sharing
  - Missing null checks when preparing share data

Technical Details:
The send/share functionality is a common Android feature that uses the ACTION_SEND intent. The crash likely occurs when:
- The note content is not properly retrieved before creating the share intent
- The intent extras are not properly set
- Required permissions or data are missing

Android Version: CyanogenMod 10.1 (Android 4.2.x)
Device: Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 (GT-I8160)

Notes:
- The issue was reported on CyanogenMod 10.1, an unofficial ROM
- However, the crash is likely a general bug not specific to the ROM
- The summary from the reporter indicates this is easily reproducible
