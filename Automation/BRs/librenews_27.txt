App Name: LibreNews

Bug Report Title:
App crashes when refreshing after changing to invalid server

Bug Report Issue:
LibreNews crashes when user changes server address to a non-LibreNews server (like Steemit.com) and then attempts to refresh.

### DESCRIPTION
The app doesn't properly validate or handle responses from non-LibreNews servers, causing a crash instead of showing an error state.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open LibreNews app
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Tap on "Server" option
4. Change server address to a different server (e.g., "Steemit.com")
5. Press the "Refresh" button
6. App crashes immediately

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
When connecting to an invalid or non-LibreNews server, the app should:
- Display a red connection icon indicating failure
- Show error message: "Server is unreachable or incompatible"
- Allow user to change server back

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
App crashes completely when attempting to refresh with non-LibreNews server configured.

### ENVIRONMENT
LibreNews version: Various
Android version: 7.0 (Nougat)
Device: Moto G5 Plus

### NOTE

Similar to issue #22

Crash Details:
- Exception Type: Likely similar to issue #22 (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or network-related exception)
- Frequency: 100% when refreshing with non-LibreNews server
- Device: Moto G5 Plus running Android 7 (Nougat)
- Video Recording: https://youtu.be/9Lf84UArX8Q

Technical Analysis:
This bug is related to insufficient error handling in the refresh/network layer. When the app attempts to:
1. Connect to a non-LibreNews server
2. Parse the response (which won't match expected format)
3. Process the data

Any of these steps can fail without proper exception handling. The app likely encounters:
- HTTP errors (404, 500, etc.) from missing LibreNews API endpoints
- JSON parsing errors from unexpected response format
- Empty or malformed data that causes array/null pointer exceptions

The connection should be wrapped in comprehensive try-catch blocks, and the UI should reflect connection state rather than crashing on errors.

Proposed Solutions:
1. Add validation to check if the server is a LibreNews-compatible server before attempting refresh
2. Wrap all network operations in proper exception handling:
   ```java
   try {
       // refresh operations
   } catch (Exception e) {
       // show error state, set connection icon to red
       Log.e(TAG, "Failed to refresh from server", e);
   }
   ```
3. Implement server compatibility check or ping endpoint
4. Add user-facing error messages for invalid server configurations
5. Gracefully degrade functionality when server is unreachable

Impact:
- Severity: High - Complete app crash
- Frequency: 100% when using non-LibreNews server
- Affected Component: Server configuration, refresh functionality, network layer
- User Impact: Users cannot experiment with different server configurations without crashing the app; app becomes unusable until server is changed back to valid address

Developer Comment:
As noted by maintainer milesmcc: "Because `Steemit.com` is not a LibreNews server, you won't be able to receive notifications from it—that being said, this is indeed a bug. The connection icon should go red; the app shouldn't crash."
