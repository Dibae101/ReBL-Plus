App Name: GnuCash Android

Bug Report Title: Persian currency symbol is doubled

Issue Description:
When IRR (Iranian Rial) is selected as the currency, the app displays two consecutive IRR currency symbols instead of just one. This visual bug affects the clarity of financial data for users using the Persian currency.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new account by tapping the yellow plus (+) button.
2. Enter an account name.
3. In the currency selection, choose IRR (Iranian Rial).
4. Save the account and view any amount displayed in the app.
5. Observe that two IRR currency symbols are shown instead of one (bug: doubled currency symbol).

Expected Behavior:
- Only a single IRR currency symbol should be displayed for amounts.

Actual Behavior:
- Two consecutive IRR currency symbols are displayed for each amount.

Environment:
- App version: 2.1.7
- Device: Smartphone
- OS: Android 4.2.2
- Reproducible: Always

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- The app incorrectly concatenates or formats the currency symbol, resulting in duplication. This was also a known bug in the main GnuCash application (see Bug 787479).

Fix/Resolution:
- The issue was fixed in commit 261a10938cd95d3ebd1bf039e86692cfdf701a83. The fix applies to new installs, but not for existing users.
