### **Bug Report: "Rename the existing custom study deck first" error when performing Custom Study on a deck named "Custom study session"**

**Description:**
When a user manually creates a deck with the specific name "Custom study session" and subsequently attempts to perform a "Custom study" action on that deck (e.g., Review ahead), pressing the back button triggers a dialog forcing the user to rename the deck. This appears to be a naming conflict between the user-created deck and the system's default name for temporary study sessions.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open AnkiDroid.
2. Tap the **+** (FAB) button and select **Create deck**.
3. Name the deck exactly: `Custom study session`.
4. Tap **OK** to create.
5. Tap (or long-press) the newly created "Custom study session" deck to open the deck options.
6. Select **Custom study**.
7. Choose an option (e.g., **Review ahead**).
8. Enter a value (e.g., `1`) and tap **OK**.
9. Press the device **Back** button to return to the deck list.

**Actual Result:**
A dialog box appears with the message: "Rename the existing custom study deck first" and a CANCEL button. The user is blocked from navigating back normally until they interact with this dialog.

**Expected Result:**
The app should either:

1. Prevent the user from manually creating a deck with the reserved name "Custom study session" initially.
2. Or, handle the Custom Study action gracefully without confusing the manual deck with the system-generated temporary deck.

**Environment:**

* **App:** AnkiDroid
* **Device:** Android Emulator / Device (as seen in video)

**Log/Error Message:**
