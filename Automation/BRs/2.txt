App Name: FamilyFinance

Bug Report Title: App crashes when changing report view to percent values

Issue Description:
When the user changes the appearance of the report in the "report" section from "view value" to "use percent value", the application crashes due to a NullPointerException. This prevents users from viewing their report data as percentages and disrupts the app experience.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch the FamilyFinance app.
2. Click the "report" option.
3. Scroll to the right side to "incomes by articles" or "expenses by articles (pie chart)".
4. Click the eye icon.
5. Change the view from "view values" to "use percent values".
6. The app crashes and stops working (bug: crash occurs when switching to percent values).

Expected Behavior:
- The app should switch the report view to percent values and display the report data accordingly, without crashing.

Actual Behavior:
- The app crashes with a NullPointerException:
  java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'void com.github.mikephil.charting.data.PieData.setDrawValues(boolean)' on a null object reference
  at io.github.zwieback.familyfinance.business.chart.fragment.PieChartFragment.onApplyDisplay(PieChartFragment.java:160)
  ...

Environment:
- App version: (not specified)
- Device: Oppo Neo 7
- OS: Android 6.1
- Reproducible: Always

Root Cause (from issue discussion):
- The app does not properly handle the case where PieData is null when switching the report view, leading to a NullPointerException.

Fix/Resolution:
- The issue was fixed in commit d365188d7c7b9d9eb0021e73e0c6dc37aba79a3f.
