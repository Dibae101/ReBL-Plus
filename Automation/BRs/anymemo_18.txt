Title: DB default settings - Crash

App: AnyMemo
Version: 9 beta 4
Package: org.liberty.android.fantastischmemo
Issue: https://code.google.com/archive/p/anymemo/issues/18

Description:
The application crashes consistently when navigating to the "DB default settings" screen through the Misc menu. This is a high-priority regression bug that was introduced in version 9 beta 4.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open AnyMemo app
2. Access the menu
3. Navigate to "Misc" menu option
4. Select "DB default settings"
5. The app crashes immediately

Expected Behavior:
The "DB default settings" screen should load properly, allowing users to:
- View current database default settings
- Modify default settings
- Load default settings using the "Load default" button
- Save or discard changes

Actual Behavior:
The application crashes every time when attempting to access the "DB default settings" screen from the Misc menu. The crash is 100% reproducible.

Crash Details:
- Trigger: Opening "DB default settings" from Misc menu
- Frequency: Every time (100% crash rate)
- Type: Regression bug (worked in previous version)
- Priority: High

Root Cause:
According to developer investigation, this was a regression issue introduced in the beta 4 release. The exact cause was identified and fixed by the developer.

Status:
Fixed in subsequent release after identification.

Notes:
- The issue was confirmed fixed in Comment #6 by the reporter
- The "Load default" button on the "DB default settings" page is intentional - it has the same effect as the discard button and helps reduce code complexity
- This was a critical bug as it completely blocked access to database default settings functionality
