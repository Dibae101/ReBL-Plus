### **Bug Report: Card Browser Preview shows incorrect card after changing sort order**

**Issue Reference:** [https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/7286](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/7286)

**Description:**
When the user changes the sort order in the Card Browser (e.g., to "By created time"), selects a specific card (e.g., card "c"), and then selects "Preview" from the options menu, the app displays a different card (e.g., card "b") instead of the selected one. This suggests an index mismatch between the sorted list view and the preview activity's data source.

**Environment:**

* **App:** AnkiDroid
* **Evidence:** Video `7286.mp4`

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open AnkiDroid
2. Tap the Hamburger icon and click on Card browser
3. Make sure to select all decks from the top menu.
4. Tap the Menu (three dots) and select Change display order.
5. Change the sort order, select By created time.
6. Long-press to select a specific card in the middle of the list.
7. Tap the Menu (three dots) and select Preview.
8. The preview screen displays a different card.

**Expected Result:**
The preview screen should display the card that was selected.

**Actual Result:**
The preview screen displays a different card (card "b").
