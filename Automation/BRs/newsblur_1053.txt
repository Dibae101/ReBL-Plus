Version: v6.1.0
Package: com.newsblur
Issue: https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/1053

Steps to Reproduce:

4. Type a username (e.g., "t")
5. Type a password (e.g., "t")
6. Click "register" or "login"

Expected Behavior:
The app should provide feedback indicating that the server address is invalid, rather than crashing.

Actual Behavior:
The app crashes with the following exception:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: unexpected url: x214w22k71g60836m2mfwk0x2cec/api/login
