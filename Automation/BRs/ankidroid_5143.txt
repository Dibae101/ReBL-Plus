Issue Summary: AnkiDroid ignores custom launcher animation settings and always uses slide-up animation when launching.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On the Android homescreen and Open Nova Launcher settings.
3. Navigate to "App drawer" section
4. Tap on "Transition Animation" option
5. Select a slide up animation and hit "OK"
6. Exit settings and return to the homescreen
7. Open the app drawer by swiping up or tapping the app drawer icon
8. Locate the AnkiDroid app icon
9. Ensure AnkiDroid is not already running in the background (force stop it if needed from system settings)
10. Tap on the AnkiDroid app icon to launch it
11. Observe the animation used when launching AnkiDroid

Expected Result: AnkiDroid should launch using the custom animation chosen in Nova Launcher settings (e.g., "Zoom" animation where the app zooms from the icon to full screen, or the selected transition effect).

Actual Result: AnkiDroid always uses a slide-up animation when launching, ignoring the custom launcher animation setting. Other apps respect the Nova Launcher animation settings and use the chosen animation, but AnkiDroid overrides it with its own slide-up animation.

Additional Notes: This issue occurs only when launching the app for the first time (not already running in RAM/background). The problem is caused by AnkiDroid's IntentHandler setting an animation on launch that overrides the system or launcher-provided animation. This affects Nova Launcher and other third-party launchers that allow custom app launch animations. The issue was fixed in PR #6809 by removing the animation override from IntentHandler and is resolved in version 2.13 and later.
