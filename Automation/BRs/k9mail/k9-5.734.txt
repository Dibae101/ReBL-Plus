App Name: Thunderbird for Android (K-9 Mail)

Bug Report Title: Message bodies for remote search results aren't downloaded automatically

Issue ID: 5292

Issue Description:
When performing a remote search on an IMAP account, the body of a message fetched from the server is not downloaded automatically when the message is opened for viewing. Instead, the message body is empty and a "Download complete message" button is displayed, requiring manual intervention to view the content.

Environment:
- App Version: 5.734-SNAPSHOT
- Account Type: IMAP
- Reproducible: Yes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up an IMAP account in Thunderbird for Android (K-9 Mail).
2. Go to Settings > [Account] > Search and enable server search.
3. Open an IMAP folder (message list screen).
4. Tap the magnifying glass to start a local search.
5. Tap the magnifying glass with the cloud icon to perform a server search.
6. Wait for the search to complete.
7. Open a search result message that was fetched from the server (doesn't show a preview).
8. Observe that the message body is empty and a "Download complete message" button is shown.

Expected Behavior:
The message body should be downloaded automatically when a search result message is opened for viewing.

Observed Behavior:
The message body is not downloaded automatically. Instead, the user must tap the "Download complete message" button to retrieve the content.

Root Cause (if known):
A storage refactoring caused either the Flag.X_DOWNLOADED_PARTIAL or Flag.X_DOWNLOADED_FULL to always be set, preventing the automatic download logic in MessageLoaderHelper from triggering. This used to work before the refactoring.
