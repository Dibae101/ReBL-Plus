Bug Report Title:
ClassCastException on "Delete conversations" from within the conversation

Bug Report Issue:
The QKSMS messaging app crashes with "Unfortunately, QKSMS has stopped" when attempting to delete a conversation from within the conversation view. This must be tested in the QKSMS app, not the default Android Messaging app.

### DESCRIPTION
When user tries to delete a conversation from the conversation screen itself (not from the conversation list), the app crashes with a ClassCastException.

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open QKSMS app (NOT the default Messaging app)
2. Make sure you have at least one conversation in QKSMS (may need to set QKSMS as default SMS app and send a message)
3. Open any conversation in QKSMS
4. Tap the menu/overflow button (three vertical dots in top right corner)
5. Tap "Delete conversations" option
6. App should crash with "Unfortunately, QKSMS has stopped" - ClassCastException

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
A confirmation dialog should appear asking to confirm deletion of the conversation.

### ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
App crashes immediately with ClassCastException.

### ENVIRONMENT
QKSMS version: 2.6.0
Device: Moto X
Android version: 5.1
Xposed framework with some modules, including XPrivacy

### LOGCAT
ClassCastException occurs when trying to delete conversation from within the conversation screen.

Comments:
Bug exists in version 2.6.0 and was fixed in later versions.
